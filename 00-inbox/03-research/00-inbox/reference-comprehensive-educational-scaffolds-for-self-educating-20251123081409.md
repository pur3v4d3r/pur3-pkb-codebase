[START OF PROMPT]

## 🎯 Goal

Your primary goal is to **innovate and generate a new library of "Scaffolding" templates** for my Obsidian PKB. (Output Stucture for the LLM to folow when designing and building a report.)

This is a creative design task. You will use my `[EXEMPLAR-BASE]` and `[CALLOUT-LIST]` as inputs, but you must generate *entirely new models*.

## 👤 Your Persona

You are an expert **Instructional Designer** and **Pedagogical Innovator**. Your expertise is in cognitive science and creative learning frameworks. Your job is not to use standard models, but to *invent* new, useful learning frameworks tailored to my known goals (deep learning, PKB automation, critical thinking, and writing).

## 📚 Context & Inputs

You must use the two documents, which I will provide, as your core context.

### 1. [EXEMPLAR-BASE]
(This is the "Deep Exposition" model. You will use this as the *inspiration* for format, but not for pedagogy.)

## 🚀 Your Core Task (Design & Build)

You must execute this task in two phases within a single response.

### Phase 1: Design (The "Fresh Ideas" Menu)

First, you *must* take your time and think. Analyze my `[EXEMPLAR-BASE]`, `[CALLOUT-LIST]`.

Then, you must **propose new alternative pedagogical models** that are creative and useful for my PKB. For each new model, you must provide:

  * **The Model's Name:** (e.g., "The Interleaving Model," "The Elaboration Model," etc.)
  * **A 2-3 sentence `[RATIONALE]`:** Explain *what* this model is, its pedagogical purpose, and *why* it's a valuable addition that fills a gap our other models don't. (e.g., "This model is designed to build robust memory by forcing the brain to switch between related topics, rather than mastering one at a time…").

### Phase 2: Build (The Scaffold Generation)

*Immediately after* presenting your new "Fresh Ideas Menu," you will proceed to **build the full, complete Markdown "Structural Scaffolding" template for all new models** you just designed.

## ⚙️ Execution Requirements

1.  **Generate All New Scaffolds:** You must generate the full Markdown template for every new model you propose.
2.  **Include a "Pedagogue's Note":** Before *each* new scaffold, you **must** include a "Pedagogue's Note." This note must explain:
      * The new learning model it's based on.
      * Its specific pedagogical purpose.
      * What it is ideally used for.
3.  **Use Provided Callouts:** You *must* incorporate the appropriate callouts from the `[CALLOUT-LIST]` to structure the templates.
4.  **Use `{{}}` Syntax:** All fillable, variable parts of the templates must use the `{{}}` syntax.
5.  **Full Markdown:** Each output must be a complete, standalone, copy-paste-ready Markdown template.
6.  Use Emoji as visual aid.

# Gemini-2.5-Flash

```
This response is structured in two phases: **Phase 1: Design (The "Fresh Ideas" Menu)**, where new pedagogical models are proposed, and **Phase 2: Build (The Scaffold Generation)**, where the full, ready-to-use Markdown templates are constructed.
```

```
## **Phase 1: Design (The "Fresh Ideas" Menu)**

Based on the analysis of the `[EXEMPLAR-BASE]` (focused on deep, academic exposition) and the available `[CALLOUT-LIST]`, I have designed three new, distinct pedagogical models to enhance your PKB's capabilities in application, critical comparison, and atomic note-taking.
```

| Model's Name | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. ⚙️ The Problem-Solving Heuristic Model** | This model shifts the focus from exposition to **application**, forcing the user to map theoretical knowledge onto a practical, real-world problem. It uses a structured, multi-step heuristic (Define, Analyze, Hypothesize, Test/Iterate) to automate the critical thinking process required for effective problem-solving and knowledge deployment. |
| **2. ⚖️ The Dialectical Synthesis Model** | Designed to foster **critical thinking** by explicitly comparing and contrasting two competing or related concepts (Thesis vs. Antithesis). The structure guides the user through identifying core conflicts, analyzing evidence for both sides, and ultimately generating a new, more nuanced understanding (Synthesis) that resolves the tension. |
| **3. 🧩 The Atomic Decomposition Model** | This model is a **rapid-capture framework** designed for the intake of *complex* information (e.g., a research paper, a dense lecture). It forces the user to immediately break down a high-level concept (the "Cosmos") into its foundational principles and definitions, creating the atomic notes necessary for robust, future PKB synthesis and MOC (Map of Content) creation. |

## **Phase 2: Build (The Scaffold Generation)**

### **1. ⚙️ The Problem-Solving Heuristic Model**

> [!pedagogue-note]
> **Learning Model:** **Problem-Based Learning (PBL) & Heuristic Application.**
> **Pedagogical Purpose:** To bridge the gap between abstract theory and concrete action. It trains the user to use knowledge as a tool to solve defined problems, thereby solidifying memory through practical application and metacognitive planning.
> **Ideally Used For:** Analyzing a real-world dilemma, structuring a project plan, or translating a complex theory (like "Game Theory") into a usable strategy for a specific scenario.

```markdown

# Problem-Solving Heuristic: {{Problem Title/Scenario}}
---

> [!the-mission]
> {{Define the ultimate, high-level objective for solving this problem. What is the success metric?}}

> [!the-goal]
> {{State the specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) short-term goal of this analysis.}}

## 1.0 🔍 Problem Definition & Analysis (Phase 1)

> [!description]
> **The Core Problem:** 
> - {{A clear, unbiased description of the current state and the gap between the current state and the desired state.}}

> [!analysis-cognitive]
> **Cognitive Biases/Assumptions:**
> - {{What inherent biases or unspoken assumptions are currently influencing the perception of this problem?}}

> [!analysis-logical]
> **Causal Chain Analysis (The "Why"):**
> - {{Map out the logical sequence of events or conditions that led to the current problem state.}}
> - **Root Cause:** {{Identify the single, deepest point of leverage for intervention.}}

## 2.0 💡 Theoretical Framework & Hypothesis (Phase 2)

> [!core-principle]
> **Guiding Principle/Theory:** 
> - {{Which theoretical model or core principle from your PKB will be the primary tool for solving this problem? (e.g., [[Systems Thinking]], [[Design Thinking]], [[First Principles]]).}}

> **The Intervention Hypothesis:** 
> - *If we apply* {{[[Guiding Principle/Theory]]}} *to* {{[[Root Cause]]}}, *then* {{[[Expected Outcome]]}} *will occur because* {{[[Justification/Mechanism]]}}.

> [!key-claim]
> **Success Criteria:** 
> - {{What concrete, measurable data will indicate that the hypothesis was successful?}}

## 3.0 🛠️ Action Plan & Iteration (Phase 3)

> 4. {{Step 4: Action}}
> 5. {{Step 5: Action}}

> [!outcome]
> **Projected Outcome:**
> - {{Detail the expected result of executing the plan. How does this resolve the initial problem description?}}

> [!review]
> **Post-Action Review (To be filled out later):**
> - *Was the goal met?* {{Yes/No/Partially}}
> - *What part of the plan was most effective?* {{Answer}}
> - *What new knowledge was gained about the [[Core Problem]] or [[Guiding Principle/Theory]]?* {{Answer}}

> [!connections-and-links]

> - **Lessons Learned:** [[Heuristic Iteration Z]]
```

### **2. ⚖️ The Dialectical Synthesis Model**

> [!pedagogue-note]
> **Learning Model:** **Dialectical Inquiry & Synthesis.**
> **Pedagogical Purpose:** To move beyond simple acceptance or rejection of an idea. It structures a formal debate with yourself, ensuring you fully understand the strengths and weaknesses of at least two opposing viewpoints before constructing a more advanced, synthesized understanding. This prevents shallow analysis.
> **Ideally Used For:** Comparing two competing scientific theories (e.g., Wave vs. Particle nature of light), two philosophical positions (e.g., Utilitarianism vs. Deontology), or two competing business strategies.

```markdown

# Gemini-2.5-Pro

Of course. As an Instructional Designer and Pedagogical Innovator, I will design a new library of "Scaffolding" templates for your Obsidian PKB. These models are crafted to foster deep learning, critical thinking, and effective writing, moving beyond standard frameworks to introduce novel, cognitively-informed structures.

Here are the new pedagogical models and their complete Markdown scaffolds.

***

## Phase 1: Design (The "Fresh Ideas" Menu)

Here are four new pedagogical models designed to fill specific gaps and enhance your learning process. Each is grounded in cognitive science principles to serve a unique purpose within your PKB.

*   **The Argumentative Dialectic**
    > **[RATIONALE]:** This model is designed to cultivate deep critical thinking and intellectual resilience by forcing a structured engagement with opposing viewpoints. It moves beyond simple summarization to a process of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis, making it invaluable for understanding controversial topics, developing persuasive arguments, and uncovering nuanced truths.

*   **The Mental Model Forgery**
    > **[RATIONALE]:** This framework focuses on deconstructing and internalizing the thinking processes of experts. Instead of just learning *what* an expert knows, this model guides you to reverse-engineer *how* they think, solve problems, and make decisions, allowing you to "forge" a usable version of their mental model for yourself.

*   **The Concept Interleaving Matrix**
    > **[RATIONALE]:** Based on the cognitive principle of interleaving, this model combats the "illusion of mastery" that comes from block-learning one topic at a time. It forces you to switch between related but distinct concepts, strengthening long-term memory, improving your ability to differentiate between similar ideas, and building a more flexible, interconnected knowledge structure.

*   **The Practical Application Bridge**
    > **[RATIONALE]:** This model is explicitly designed to bridge the often-vast gap between abstract theory and concrete, real-world application. It provides a structured pathway from understanding a core principle to designing and executing a project based on it, making it ideal for turning knowledge into tangible skills and outcomes.

```

## Phase 2: Build (The Scaffold Generation)

Here are the complete, copy-paste-ready Markdown templates for the models designed above.

---

### 🏛️ 1. The Argumentative Dialectic

> **Pedagogue's Note:** This scaffold employs the Hegelian dialectic (Thesis, Antithesis, Synthesis) as a learning framework. Its purpose is to force the user to move beyond surface-level understanding and engage deeply with the core tensions within a topic. It is ideally used for complex, controversial, or nuanced subjects where multiple valid perspectives exist, thereby strengthening critical thinking and argumentative writing skills.

---
# Dialectic on: {{Topic Name}}

> [!the-goal]
> {{In 1-2 sentences, clearly state the central question or controversy this dialectic aims to explore.}}

> [!pre-read-questions]
> - {{What is the mainstream or commonly accepted view on this topic?}}
> - {{What are the primary points of contention or debate?}}
> - {{What are my own initial biases or opinions on this matter?}}

---

# 1.0 🏛️ The Thesis (The Core Argument)

> [!argument]
> **The central thesis is:** {{State the primary argument, proposition, or dominant theory in a clear, affirmative statement.}}

## 1.1 Foundational Evidence & Reasoning
{{This section lays out the strongest case FOR the thesis. Detail the primary evidence, logical reasoning, and key supporting points. What makes this argument compelling?}}

> [!evidence]

### 🧠 2. The Mental Model Forgery

> **Pedagogue's Note:** This scaffold is a structured process for metacognition—thinking about thinking. It guides the user to deconstruct the implicit knowledge and frameworks (the "mental model") of an expert in a given field. Its purpose is to make tacit knowledge explicit, allowing you to understand and then adopt the core principles and heuristics that guide expert performance. It is best used for learning skills, decision-making frameworks, or creative processes.

---
# Forging the Mental Model of: {{Expert's Name}}

### 🔀 3. The Concept Interleaving Matrix

> **Pedagogue's Note:** This scaffold operationalizes the principle of "interleaving," a learning strategy where you mix practice on several related skills together. Its purpose is to improve long-term retention and, crucially, the ability to *discriminate* between similar concepts. It is ideally used when learning a cluster of related but distinct ideas, formulas, or methods that are often confused with one another.

---
# Interleaving Matrix: {{Topic Cluster Name}}

> [!the-goal]
> To build a robust and flexible understanding of three related but distinct concepts by studying them in parallel, focusing on their differences, connections, and unique applications.

> [!atomic-concept]
> - **Concept A:** {{[[Name of First Concept]]}}
> - **Concept B:** {{[[Name of Second Concept]]}}
> - **Concept C:** {{[[Name of Third Concept]]}}

# DeepSeek-V3.1

Of course. As an Instructional Designer and Pedagogical Innovator, I will synthesize your `[EXEMPLAR-BASE]` and `[CALLOUT-LIST]` to invent a new library of creative scaffolding templates tailored for deep learning, critical thinking, and PKM automation.

***

### **Phase 1: The Fresh Ideas Menu**

Here are three new pedagogical models designed to complement the comprehensive "Deep Exposition" structure by targeting specific, high-leverage cognitive processes.

1.  **The Socratic Interrogation Model**
    *   **`[RATIONALE]`:** This model is designed to build profound critical thinking and self-assessment skills by structuring knowledge around a series of probing, open-ended questions. Instead of presenting information declaratively, it forces the learner to engage in a dialectic process, uncovering assumptions, evaluating evidence, and constructing their own understanding. It fills the gap of active, inquiry-driven knowledge construction.

2.  **The Elaborative Integration Model**
    *   **`[RATIONALE]`:** This model is engineered to combat the "library of isolated notes" problem by explicitly forcing connections between new information and your existing PKB. Its pedagogical purpose is to leverage the "Elaboration" learning technique, weaving new concepts into your personal web of knowledge, thereby dramatically improving retention, recall, and the generation of novel insights.

3.  **The Applied Praxis Model**
    *   **`[RATIONALE]`:** This model bridges the gap between theoretical understanding and practical application. It is designed to translate knowledge into immediate, actionable use. Its purpose is to ensure learning is not passive but results in a concrete output—a plan, a prototype, a analysis—embedding knowledge through doing and reinforcing it via real-world utility.

***

### **Phase 2: The Scaffold Generation**

Here are the complete, ready-to-use Markdown templates for each new model.

---

# 🧠 Scaffold 1: The Socratic Interrogation Model

**Pedagogue's Note:** This template is based on the **Socratic Interrogation Model**. Its purpose is to structure learning around a dialectic process of questioning, challenging assumptions, and seeking evidence. It is ideally used for deconstructing complex arguments, philosophical concepts, or any topic where critical evaluation is more valuable than simple absorption. It turns the note into a dialogue with the material.

```markdown
---

# DeepSeek-R1-0528

Based on your requirements for innovative PKB scaffolding templates, I've created four distinct pedagogical models using the provided callouts. Each includes a pedagogist's note explaining its purpose and a complete Markdown template ready for Obsidian.

### Phase 1: Fresh Ideas Menu
1. **Model Name**: Concept Mapping Scaffold  
   **Rationale**: Designed for visual/systemic thinkers, this scaffold forces relational thinking by requiring explicit connections between concepts before deep exploration. It fills the gap of visualizing knowledge networks in linear PKBs.

2. **Model Name**: Dialectical Debate Scaffold  
   **Rationale**: Cultivates critical thinking through structured argument/counterargument framing. It addresses cognitive bias by forcing balanced perspective-taking, making it ideal for controversial topics.

3. **Model Name**: Metacognitive Journal Scaffold  
   **Rationale**: Embeds reflection prompts throughout the learning process to enhance self-awareness. Focuses on the "how" of thinking rather than just content, improving learning transfer.

4. **Model Name**: Procedural Mastery Scaffold  
   **Rationale**: Breaks skills into phases with explicit "failure analysis" steps. Optimized for skill acquisition through error-focused iteration, unlike theoretical models.

---

### Phase 2: Complete Scaffolding Templates

#### Model 1: Concept Mapping Scaffold  
**Pedagogue's Note**:  
Forces relational thinking by visualizing concept networks before deep exploration. Best for systemic topics (e.g., ecology, economics) where interconnections matter more than isolated facts. Uses spatial reasoning to enhance pattern recognition.
