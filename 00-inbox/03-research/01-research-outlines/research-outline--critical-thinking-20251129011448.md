## 🧭 Learning Path Architecture

> [!principle-point] Sequencing Rationale
> This curriculum follows Bloom's hierarchical framework where each stage of learning is a prerequisite for the next stage. We begin with conceptual foundations (understanding what CT IS and its cognitive architecture), progress to the structural elements (Paul-Elder's Elements of Thought), then build evaluative capabilities (Intellectual Standards and bias recognition), develop metacognitive awareness (self-regulation and intellectual traits), and finally apply these integrated skills to academic knowledge work and PKB curation. This mirrors how critical thinking converts raw data and facts into meaningful understanding and insight through systematic skill development.

### Phase 1: Foundation Building (Weeks 1-3)
Establishing conceptual framework and cognitive architecture of critical thinking

### Phase 2: Core Standards & Skills Development (Weeks 4-7)  
Building analytical and evaluative capabilities through systematic practice

### Phase 3: Integration & Metacognitive Development (Weeks 8-10)
Developing self-awareness and intellectual character traits

### Phase 4: Application to Academic Knowledge Work (Weeks 11-12)
Applying CT skills to research, synthesis, and PKB integration

## 📚 Topic Breakdown & Pedagogical Mapping

### Topic 1: Foundations of Critical Thinking - Cognitive Architecture and Frameworks

> [!definition] Learning Objectives
> - Understand multiple definitions and conceptualizations of critical thinking from philosophy, cognitive psychology, and education
> - Map the cognitive architecture underlying CT (working memory, executive function, metacognition)
> - Compare major CT frameworks (Paul-Elder, Facione, Bloom's Taxonomy, ACER)
> - Recognize CT as the bridge between information access and knowledge acquisition

**Pedagogical Approach**: **Foundational**  
**Rationale**: Before developing CT skills, you need a clear conceptual framework. This foundational approach builds your mental model of what CT is, how it operates cognitively, and why it's essential for knowledge work. Understanding the theoretical landscape prevents confusion later when working with specific frameworks.

**Key Questions to Explore**:
1. What distinguishes critical thinking from general intelligence or domain expertise?
2. How does critical thinking transform information into actionable knowledge?
3. What are the core cognitive processes involved in critical thinking?
4. How do different disciplines conceptualize and operationalize CT?

**PKB Capture Strategy**:
- Core concepts to wiki-link: [[Critical Thinking]], [[Metacognition]], [[Executive Function]], [[Working Memory]], [[Paul-Elder Framework]], [[Bloom's Taxonomy]], [[Facione's CT Model]], [[ACER Framework]], [[Epistemology]], [[Cognitive Architecture]]
- Recommended tags: #critical-thinking/foundations #cognitive-science #educational-theory
- Connection points: Links to existing [[Cognitive Science]], [[Learning Theory]], [[Philosophy]] notes; creates foundation for all subsequent CT topics

**Prerequisites**: Basic familiarity with cognitive psychology concepts helpful but not required

---

### Topic 2: Paul-Elder Framework Part 1 - The Elements of Thought

> [!definition] Learning Objectives
> - Master the 8 Elements of Thought/Reasoning that structure all thinking
> - Apply the Elements framework to analyze your own reasoning processes
> - Use the Elements to deconstruct arguments, texts, and claims systematically
> - Recognize how the Elements interrelate to form coherent reasoning

**Pedagogical Approach**: **First-Principles**  
**Rationale**: The Elements of Thought are the fundamental "parts" of thinking that students need to master. This first-principles approach treats the 8 Elements as axioms of reasoning - every instance of thought contains these components. By mastering these foundational building blocks, you can systematically analyze and improve any reasoning process.

**Key Questions to Explore**:
1. What is the Question at Issue we're trying to answer?
2. What is my Purpose in this thinking? What am I trying to accomplish?
3. What Information (data/evidence) am I using to make my decision?
4. What Assumptions am I making (taking for granted)?
5. What Inferences and Interpretations am I drawing from the information?
6. What Concepts (theories, principles, models) am I employing to understand this?
7. What are the Implications and Consequences of my reasoning?
8. What is my Point of View, and how might alternative perspectives see this differently?

**PKB Capture Strategy**:
- Core concepts to wiki-link: [[Elements of Thought]], [[Purpose in Reasoning]], [[Question at Issue]], [[Information vs Evidence]], [[Assumptions]], [[Inferences]], [[Concepts and Theories]], [[Implications]], [[Point of View]], [[Perspective-Taking]], [[Reasoning Structure]]
- Recommended tags: #critical-thinking/paul-elder #reasoning-framework #elements-of-thought
- Connection points: Create [[MOC - Paul-Elder Framework]]; links to [[Argumentation]], [[Logic]], [[Analytical Thinking]]

**Prerequisites**: Topic 1 (understanding of CT frameworks)

---

### Topic 3: Paul-Elder Framework Part 2 - Intellectual Standards

> [!definition] Learning Objectives
> - Learn the 9 Universal Intellectual Standards for evaluating reasoning quality
> - Apply standards systematically to assess arguments, claims, and your own thinking
> - Develop the habit of asking standard-based questions (e.g., "Is this clear?", "Is this accurate?", "Is this relevant?")
> - Recognize when reasoning fails to meet appropriate standards

**Pedagogical Approach**: **Analytical**  
**Rationale**: The intellectual standards are used to determine the quality of reasoning. This analytical approach teaches you to evaluate thinking rigorously using explicit criteria. Standards transform CT from vague "good thinking" into systematic quality assessment with specific benchmarks.

**Key Questions to Explore**:
1. Is my thinking Clear - easy to understand and well-explained?
2. Is it Accurate - correct and free from error?
3. Is it Precise - exact with sufficient detail?
4. Is it Relevant - connected to the question at hand?
5. Does it have Depth - dealing with complexities adequately?
6. Does it have Breadth - considering other viewpoints?
7. Is it Logical - making sense step-by-step with conclusions following from evidence?
8. Does it address what is Significant - focusing on the most important ideas?
9. Is it Fair - balanced and free from bias?

**PKB Capture Strategy**:
- Core concepts to wiki-link: [[Intellectual Standards]], [[Clarity]], [[Accuracy]], [[Precision]], [[Relevance]], [[Depth]], [[Breadth]], [[Logic]], [[Significance]], [[Fairness]], [[Quality of Reasoning]], [[Evaluation Criteria]]
- Recommended tags: #critical-thinking/intellectual-standards #evaluation-framework
- Connection points: Links to [[MOC - Paul-Elder Framework]], [[Epistemology]], [[Truth]], [[Evidence]], [[Argumentation]]

**Prerequisites**: Topics 1-2 (CT foundations and Elements of Thought)

---

### Topic 4: Cognitive Biases and Logical Fallacies

> [!definition] Learning Objectives
> - Identify common cognitive biases that distort reasoning (confirmation bias, availability heuristic, anchoring, etc.)
> - Recognize logical fallacies in arguments (ad hominem, straw man, false dichotomy, slippery slope, etc.)
> - Understand the psychological mechanisms behind biased thinking
> - Develop strategies to mitigate bias in your own thinking and recognize it in others

**Pedagogical Approach**: **Problem-Solving**  
**Rationale**: Biases and fallacies represent systematic errors in thinking. A problem-solving approach allows you to diagnose these errors as specific problems with identifiable solutions. By treating bias recognition as a debugging process, you develop practical skills for improving reasoning quality in real-world contexts.

**Key Questions to Explore**:
1. What are the most prevalent cognitive biases affecting academic knowledge acquisition?
2. How do System 1 (fast, intuitive) and System 2 (slow, deliberate) thinking contribute to bias?
3. Why are we susceptible to logical fallacies despite knowing about them?
4. How can I design my PKB system and note-taking practices to counter cognitive biases?
5. What is the relationship between egocentric/sociocentric thinking and bias?

**PKB Capture Strategy**:
- Core concepts to wiki-link: [[Cognitive Bias]], [[Confirmation Bias]], [[Availability Heuristic]], [[Anchoring Bias]], [[Dunning-Kruger Effect]], [[Logical Fallacies]], [[Ad Hominem]], [[Straw Man]], [[False Dichotomy]], [[Appeal to Authority]], [[System 1 and System 2 Thinking]], [[Heuristics]], [[Egocentric Thinking]], [[Sociocentric Thinking]]
- Recommended tags: #cognitive-bias #logical-fallacies #critical-thinking/error-detection
- Connection points: Create [[MOC - Cognitive Biases]]; links to [[Behavioral Economics]], [[Decision Making]], [[Epistemology]], [[Psychology]]

**Prerequisites**: Topics 1-3 (foundation, elements, and standards provide framework for identifying violations)

---

### Topic 5: Argument Analysis and Evaluation

> [!definition] Learning Objectives
> - Deconstruct arguments into premises, inferences, and conclusions
> - Evaluate argument strength using validity and soundness criteria
> - Distinguish between deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning
> - Assess evidence quality and relevance
> - Identify hidden assumptions and unstated premises

**Pedagogical Approach**: **Analytical**  
**Rationale**: Argumentation is the primary vehicle for academic knowledge claims. An analytical approach provides systematic tools for dissecting complex arguments into component parts, evaluating each component, and assessing overall reasoning quality. This skill is fundamental to engaging with academic literature critically.

**Key Questions to Explore**:
1. What makes an argument valid? What makes it sound?
2. How do I identify the logical structure of complex arguments?
3. What criteria should I use to evaluate evidence quality?
4. How do I recognize and assess analogical reasoning?
5. What role do warrants play in connecting evidence to claims?

**PKB Capture Strategy**:
- Core concepts to wiki-link: [[Argument]], [[Premise]], [[Conclusion]], [[Inference]], [[Validity]], [[Soundness]], [[Deductive Reasoning]], [[Inductive Reasoning]], [[Abductive Reasoning]], [[Evidence]], [[Warrant]], [[Toulmin Model]], [[Argument Structure]], [[Hidden Assumptions]]
- Recommended tags: #argumentation #critical-thinking/analysis #logic
- Connection points: Links to [[Logic]], [[Rhetoric]], [[Epistemology]], [[Academic Writing]]; create [[MOC - Argumentation Theory]]

**Prerequisites**: Topics 1-4 (need Elements framework, Standards, and bias awareness)

---

### Topic 6: Paul-Elder Framework Part 3 - Intellectual Traits and Development Stages

> [!definition] Learning Objectives
> - Understand the 8 Intellectual Traits of a cultivated critical thinker
> - Assess your current stage of CT development (Unreflective → Challenged → Beginning → Practicing → Advanced → Master Thinker)
> - Develop strategies for cultivating intellectual virtues over time
> - Recognize the relationship between consistent application of Standards and development of Traits

**Pedagogical Approach**: **Dialectical** + **Socratic**  
**Rationale**: Consistent application of the standards of thinking to the elements of thinking result in the development of intellectual traits. The dialectical approach examines the tension between current thinking habits and aspirational intellectual virtues, while Socratic questioning prompts deep self-examination. This combination fosters genuine character development, not just skill acquisition.

**Key Questions to Explore**:
1. What does it mean to have Intellectual Humility - recognizing the limits of my knowledge?
2. How do I develop Intellectual Courage to question my deeply held beliefs?
3. What is Intellectual Empathy and how does it differ from emotional empathy?
4. How do Intellectual Integrity and Fairmindedness work together?
5. What stage of CT development am I currently in, and what specific practices will move me forward?
6. How does Confidence in Reasoning develop through practice?

**PKB Capture Strategy**:
- Core concepts to wiki-link: [[Intellectual Traits]], [[Intellectual Humility]], [[Intellectual Courage]], [[Intellectual Empathy]], [[Intellectual Integrity]], [[Intellectual Perseverance]], [[Fairmindedness]], [[Confidence in Reasoning]], [[Intellectual Autonomy]], [[Stages of CT Development]], [[Virtue Epistemology]], [[Character Development]]
- Recommended tags: #critical-thinking/intellectual-traits #virtue-epistemology #self-development
- Connection points: Complete [[MOC - Paul-Elder Framework]]; links to [[Ethics]], [[Virtue Ethics]], [[Epistemology]], [[Self-Improvement]]

**Prerequisites**: Topics 1-5 (need full understanding of Elements and Standards framework)

---

### Topic 7: Metacognition and Self-Regulated Learning

> [!definition] Learning Objectives
> - Understand metacognition as "thinking about thinking"
> - Develop monitoring and control processes for your learning
> - Apply metacognitive strategies to academic knowledge acquisition
> - Integrate metacognitive reflection into your PKB workflow
> - Use self-questioning to regulate your thinking processes

**Pedagogical Approach**: **Systems Analysis**  
**Rationale**: Kuhn proposes that the most relevant cognitive competencies to critical thinking are all metacognitive (meta-knowing skills). Systems analysis treats your mind as a complex system with feedback loops, monitoring processes, and control mechanisms. Understanding this system allows you to consciously optimize your thinking and learning processes.

**Key Questions to Explore**:
1. What are metastrategic skills and how do they guide my learning approach?
2. How do I monitor my comprehension and know when I don't understand something?
3. What self-questioning strategies enhance my metacognitive awareness?
4. What is the relationship between metacognition and self-regulation?
5. How can I build metacognitive reflection directly into my PKB note-taking process?

**PKB Capture Strategy**:
- Core concepts to wiki-link: [[Metacognition]], [[Self-Regulated Learning]], [[Metastrategic Knowledge]], [[Metacognitive Monitoring]], [[Metacognitive Control]], [[Comprehension Monitoring]], [[Self-Questioning]], [[Reflection]], [[Learning Strategies]], [[Cognitive Regulation]]
- Recommended tags: #metacognition #self-regulated-learning #critical-thinking/meta-awareness
- Connection points: Links to [[Learning Theory]], [[Cognitive Science]], [[Andragogy]], [[Personal Knowledge Management]]; bridge to PKB application topics

**Prerequisites**: Topics 1-6 (need full CT framework to apply metacognitive monitoring)

---

### Topic 8: Critical Thinking in Academic Knowledge Acquisition

> [!definition] Learning Objectives
> - Apply CT frameworks to evaluate academic sources and research claims
> - Develop systematic literature review and synthesis skills
> - Use CT to identify research gaps, methodological limitations, and logical issues in academic work
> - Practice constructing well-reasoned academic arguments
> - Integrate multiple perspectives through critical synthesis

**Pedagogical Approach**: **Case Studies**  
**Rationale**: Critical thinking involves breaking down complex information, assessing credibility and logical strength of evidence, drawing reasoned conclusions, and using critical analysis to find solutions. Case studies of actual academic papers, debates, and research programs provide concrete contexts for applying all previously learned CT skills in authentic academic settings.

**Key Questions to Explore**:
1. How do I critically evaluate methodology sections in empirical research?
2. What questions should I ask when reading theoretical or philosophical arguments?
3. How do I identify and assess the quality of evidence in different disciplines?
4. What does it mean to synthesize across sources rather than just summarize them?
5. How can I use the Paul-Elder Elements to analyze an academic article systematically?

**PKB Capture Strategy**:
- Core concepts to wiki-link: [[Source Evaluation]], [[Research Methodology]], [[Literature Review]], [[Academic Synthesis]], [[Peer Review]], [[Research Claims]], [[Evidence Quality]], [[Theoretical Framework]], [[Empirical Research]], [[Scholarly Communication]], [[Research Gaps]]
- Recommended tags: #academic-skills #research-methods #critical-thinking/application
- Connection points: Links to [[Research Methodology]], [[Academic Writing]], [[Information Literacy]], [[Scholarship]]; prepares for PKB integration

**Prerequisites**: Topics 1-7 (need complete CT toolkit to apply to academic contexts)

---

### Topic 9: Integrating Critical Thinking into PKB Systems

> [!definition] Learning Objectives
> - Design evidence-based note-taking templates that enforce CT standards
> - Create PKB workflows that systematically apply Elements of Thought
> - Develop tagging and linking strategies that surface bias and strengthen reasoning
> - Build CT checkpoints into your knowledge synthesis process
> - Use your PKB as a metacognitive reflection tool

**Pedagogical Approach**: **Problem-Solving**  
**Rationale**: The ultimate goal is not just knowing about CT but making it automatic in your knowledge work. Problem-solving approach tackles the practical challenge: "How do I embed CT into my daily PKB practice so it becomes habitual?" This creates sustainable, systematic critical thinking in all knowledge acquisition.

**Key Questions to Explore**:
1. How can I design note templates that prompt application of Intellectual Standards?
2. What PKB structures help me track assumptions, evaluate evidence, and identify implications?
3. How do I use wiki-links and tags to make my reasoning transparent and revisable?
4. What workflow ensures I'm not just collecting information but critically evaluating it?
5. How can I use my PKB to detect patterns in my own biased thinking over time?

**PKB Capture Strategy**:
- Core concepts to wiki-link: [[PKB Design]], [[Note Templates]], [[Evidence-Based Notes]], [[Critical Note-Taking]], [[Knowledge Synthesis]], [[Thinking Tools]], [[Obsidian Workflows]], [[Metacognitive Reflection]], [[Reasoning Transparency]], [[Knowledge Evaluation]]
