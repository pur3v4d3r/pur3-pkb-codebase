> [!the-purpose]
> **Primary Objective**
> To internalize the cognitive framework of Epictetus, specifically focusing on the separation of external events from internal judgments, and to align the PKB with the moral compass of a self-determined knowledge worker.

> [!pre-read-questions]
> 1. How does Epictetus define the relationship between the human mind and the Cosmic administration?
> 2. What specific "reframing" techniques does he offer for moments of distress?
> 3. How can I apply the concept of "The Witness" (God within) to my daily prompt engineering work?

### I. The Hymn of the Rational Being

> [!cosmos-concept]
> **The Teleological Argument**
> Epictetus argues that biological function implies a designer, but *cognitive* function implies a duty to praise that designer.

Are these the only works of Providence within us? What words suffice to praise or set them forth? Had we but understanding, should we ever cease hymning and blessing the Divine Power, both openly and in secret, and telling of His gracious gifts? Whether digging or ploughing or eating, should we not sing the hymn to God:—

> [!quote]
> *Great is God, for that He hath given us such instruments to till the ground withal! Great is God, for that He hath given us hands and the power of swallowing and digesting; of unconsciously growing and breathing while we sleep!*

Thus should we ever have sung; yea and this, the **grandest and divinest hymn of all**:—

> [!key-claim]
> **Great is God, for that He hath given us a mind to apprehend these things, and duly to use them!**

What then! seeing that most of you are blinded, should there not be some one to fill this place, and sing the hymn to God on behalf of all men? What else can I that am old and lame do but sing to God? Were I a nightingale, I should do after the manner of a nightingale. Were I a swan, I should do after the manner of a swan. 

> [!identity]
> **The Rational Function**
> But now, since I am a **reasonable being**, I must sing to God: that is my work: I do it, nor will I desert this my post, as long as it is granted me to hold it; and upon you too I call to join in this self-same hymn.

### II. The Inn and the Destination

> [!analogy]
> **The Distraction of the Pleasant Inn**
> Life is a journey; external pleasures are merely rest stops, not the destination.

How then do men act? As though one returning to his country who had sojourned for the night in a fair inn, should be so captivated thereby as to take up his abode there.

*“Friend, thou hast forgotten thine intention! This was not thy destination, but only lay on the way thither.”*

*“Nay, but it is a proper place.”*

“And how many more of the sort there may be; only to pass through upon thy way! Thy purpose was to return to thy country; to relieve thy kinsmen’s fears for thee; thyself to discharge the duties of a citizen; to marry a wife, to beget offspring, and to fill the appointed round of office. **Thou didst not come to choose out what places are most pleasant; but rather to return to that wherein thou wast born and where wert appointed to be a citizen.**”

### III. Community

> [!principle-point]
> Try to enjoy the great festival of life with other men.

### IV. The Rules of Use

> [!core-principle]
> **The Sovereign Will**
> The only thing truly entrusted to us is our Will ([[Prohairesis]]).

But I have one whom I must please, to whom I must be subject, whom I must obey:—[[God]], and those who come next to Him. He hath entrusted me with myself: **He hath made my will subject to myself alone and given me rules for the right use thereof.**

### V. The Mirror of Faults

> [!insight]
> **On Constructive Criticism**
> True praise helps us identify our errors.

Rufus used to say, *If you have leisure to praise me, what I say is naught.* In truth he spoke in such wise, that each of us who sat there, though that some one had accused him to Rufus:—**so surely did he lay his finger on the very deeds we did: so surely display the faults of each before his very eyes.**

### VI. The Portion of God

> [!analysis-cognitive]
> **The Deal with Reality**
> We trade control over the body and property for absolute control over our judgment.

But what saith God?—“Had it been possible, Epictetus, I would have made both that body of thine and thy possessions free and unimpeded, but as it is, **be not deceived:—it is not thine own; it is but finely tempered clay.** Since then this I could not do, I have given thee a portion of Myself, in the power of desiring and declining and of pursuing and avoiding, and in a word the power of dealing with the things of sense. And if thou neglect not this, but place all that thou hast therein, thou shalt never be let or hindered; thou shalt never lament; thou shalt not blame or flatter any. What then? Seemth this to thee a little thing?”

—*God forbid!*

—“Be content then therewith!”

And so I pray the Gods.


### VII. The Cost of Leadership

> [!key-claim]
> **The Price of Excellence**
> *It is a kingly thing, O Cyrus, to do well and to be evil spoken of.*

### VIII. The Purple Thread

> [!analogy]
> **The Thread in the Tunic**
> Epictetus uses the "purple thread" to explain why one should not conform to the majority (the white threads) if they wish to be distinct.

“Aye, but to debase myself thus were unworthy of me.”

“That,” said Epictetus, “is for you to consider, not for me. **You know yourself what you are worth in your own eyes; and at what price you will sell yourself.** For men sell themselves at various prices…

“Why?”

“Because you think yourself but one among the many threads which make up the texture of the doublet. You should aim at being like men in general—just as your thread has no ambition either to be anything distinguished compared with the other threads. **But I desire to be the purple—that small and shining part which makes the rest seem fair and beautiful.** Why then do you bid me become even as the multitude? Then were I no longer the purple.”

### IX. Dual Citizenship (Earth & Heaven)

> [!identity]
> **The Two Elements of Man**
> We are a compound of body (animal) and Reason (Divine). Our self-image dictates our behavior.

If a man could be throughly penetrated, as he ought, with this thought, that we are all in an especial manner sprung from [[God]], and that God is the Father of men as well as of Gods, full surely he would never conceive aught ignoble or base of himself…

Since then every one must deal with each thing according to the view which he forms about it, those few who hold that they are born for fidelity, modesty, and unerring sureness in dealing with the things of sense, never conceive aught base or ignoble of themselves: but the multitude the contrary.

> [!question]
> *Why then cling to the one [the flesh], and neglect the other [the Reason]?*

### X. The Definition of Self

> [!insight]
> **The Soul-Body Relation**
> *Thou art but a poor soul laden with a lifeless body.*

### XI. The Iron Lamp (Attachment)

> [!story]
> **The Thief's Logic**
> Epictetus reframes the loss of property as an inevitability of the object's nature.

The other day I had an iron lamp placed beside my household gods. I heard a noise at the door and on hastening down found my lamp carried off. I reflected that the culprit was in no very strange case.

*“Tomorrow, my friend,”* I said, *“you will find an earthenware lamp; **for a man can only lose what he has.**”*

### XII. The Price of Virtue

> [!analysis-cognitive]
> **The Transaction of Character**
> Every external loss is a trade. The thief paid with his integrity to gain a lamp.

The reason why I lost my lamp was that the thief was superior to me in vigilance. He paid however this price for the lamp, that **in exchange for it he consented to become a thief: in exchange for it, to become faithless.**

### XIII. The Observer

> [!the-mission]
> **Man as Spectator and Interpreter**
> God introduced Man to be a spectator of Himself and of His works; and not a spectator only, but also an interpreter of them.

Wherefore it is a shame for man to begin and to leave off where the brutes do. Rather he should begin there, and **leave off where Nature leaves off in us: and that is at contemplation, and understanding, and a manner of life that is in harmony with herself.**

### XIV. The Great Spectacle

> [!reframing]
> **Endurance as Ticket Price**
> Just as we endure the heat at Olympia to see the games, we must endure life's hardships to witness the Universe.

“Well, but in life there are some things disagreeable and hard to bear.”

And are there none at Olympia? Are you not scorched by the heat? … Well, I suppose you set all this over against the splendour of the spectacle and bear it patiently. What then? **have you not received greatness of heart, received courage, received fortitude?**

### XV. The Cosmopolitan

> [!identity]
> **Citizen of the World**
> Never, when asked one’s country, to answer, *“I am an Athenian or a Corinthian,”* but *“I am a citizen of the world.”*

### XVI. Freedom from Fear

> [!logic]
> **The Divine Kinship Security**
> If kinship with Caesar protects you, surely kinship with God should protect you from sorrow and fear.

### XVII. The Desire to Escape

> [!warning]
> **Against Suicide (The Open Door)**
> Epictetus addresses young students who, realizing the body is a prison, wish to "cast off these chains" prematurely.

You would come to me and say: *“Epictetus, we can no longer endure being chained to this wretched body… Are we not in a manner kinsmen of the Gods, and have we not come from them? Let us depart thither, whence we came…”*

### XVIII. The Divine Signal

> [!core-principle]
> **Wait for the Command**
> We must remain at our post until God sounds the retreat.

*“Friends, wait for God. When He gives the signal, and releases you from this service, then depart to Him. But for the present, **endure to dwell in the place wherein He hath assigned you your post.**”*

### XIX. The Tyrant's Power

> [!analysis-logical]
> **The Limits of External Power**
> Tyrants only control the "lifeless body," not the Will.

The teacher is a lifeless body, and you are lifeless bodies yourselves…. Why should you stand in awe of them that have much or are placed in power…?

> [!key-claim]
> **What they can do, we will not regard: what does concern us, that they cannot do.**

### XX. The Equipment for Life

> [!empowerment]
> **The Toolkit of Faculties**
> God gave us faculties to bear every event without being crushed. To complain is to ignore the tools in your hand.

Yet God has not only given us these faculties by means of which we may bear everything that comes to pass without being crushed or depressed thereby; but like a good King and Father, **He has given us this without let or hindrance, placed wholly at our own disposition.**

### XXI. The Exemplar

> [!exemplar]
> **Socrates**
> How did Socrates bear himself in this regard? How else than as became one who was fully assured that he was the kinsman of Gods?

### XXII. The Nature of Freedom

> [!definition]
> **Absolute Agency**
> If you choose, you are free; if you choose, you need blame no man—accuse no man. All things will be at once according to your mind and according to the Mind of God.

### XXIII. Cognitive Petrifaction

> [!warning]
> **Hardening of the Mind**
> There is a "petrifaction" (turning to stone) of the sense of shame.

Most of us dread mortification of the body… But of mortification of the soul we are utterly heedless…. But mortification of the sense of shame and modesty we go so far as to dub strength of mind!

### XXIV. The Trap of Ambition

> [!story]
> **The Return to Rome**
> A story of an official who swore to retire, but was immediately seduced by a letter from the Emperor.

Ere ever he entered the city, he was met by a despatch from the Emperor. He took it, and forgot the whole of his resolutions…. **All day long they do nothing but calculate, contrive, consult how to wring their profit out of food-stuffs, farm-plots and the like.**

### XXV. Pity vs. Reality

> [!reframing]
> **Rejection of Pity**
> *“I asked for your help, not for your pity. No evil has happened unto me.”*

### XXVI. The Definition of Instruction

> [!definition]
> **True Instruction**
> To learn to wish that each thing should come to pass as it does.

### XXVII. The Exchange Rate

> [!insight]
> **Loss and Gain**
> Have this thought ever present with thee, when thou losest any outward thing, **what thou gainest in its stead**; and if this be the more precious, say not, I have suffered loss.

### XXVIII. Theological Stances

> [!disposition]
> **The Fifth Stance (Socrates & Ulysses)**
> *I move not without Thy knowledge!*

### XXIX. Freedom and Madness

> [!logic]
> **The Logic of Freedom**
> Freedom is not "getting what you want," but "wanting what you get."

*“But I wish all that I desire to come to pass and in the manner that I desire.”*

—**You are mad, you are beside yourself.** Know you not that Freedom is a glorious thing and of great worth? But that what I desired at random I should wish at random to come to pass, so far from being noble, may well be exceeding base.

### XXX. Maintenance of Principles

> [!to-do]
> **Daily Practice**
> You must know that it is no easy thing for a principle to become a man’s own, unless each day he maintain it and hear it maintained, as well as work it out in life.

### XXXI. Solitude vs. Crowd

> [!reframing]
> **Contextual Re-labeling**
> - When alone: Call it **Tranquility** and **Freedom**.
> - When in a crowd: Call it an **Assembly** and a **Tribunal**.

### XXXII. The True Prison

> [!insight]
> **The Prison of the Will**
> Wherever a man is against his will, that to him is a prison. Thus Socrates was not in prison, since he was there with his own consent.

### XXXIII. The Measure of Greatness

> [!perspective]
> **Reason is not Measured by Space**
> Knowest thou what a speck thou art in comparison with the Universe?—That is, with respect to the body; **since with respect to Reason, thou art not inferior to the Gods, nor less than they.**

### XXXIV. Dealing with Slaves (and Hierarchy)

> [!social-dynamics]
> **Universal Brotherhood**
> Slave, will you not endure your own brother, that has God to his forefather? … Do you see whither you are looking—down to the earth, to the pit, to those despicable laws of the dead? But to the laws of the Gods you do not look.

### XXXV. The Banquet of Life

> [!analogy]
> **Table Manners for Life**
> When we are invited to a banquet, we take what is set before us; and were one to call upon his host to set fish upon the table or sweet things, he would be deemed absurd. **Yet in a word, we ask the Gods for what they do not give; and that, although they have given us so many things!**

### XXXVI. The Cosmic Sympathy

> [!cosmos-concept]
> **Sympatheia (Universal Interconnection)**
> Do you not hold that things on earth and things in heaven are continuous and in unison with each other?

“Else how should the trees so regularly, as though by [[God]]’s command, at His bidding flower… How else, as the Moon waxes and wanes, as the Sun approaches and recedes, can it be that such vicissitude and alternation is seen in earthly things?”

If then all things… are thus bound up with the whole, is not this still truer of our souls? **And if our souls are bound up and in contact with God, as being very parts and fragments plucked from Himself, shall He not feel every movement of theirs as though it were His own?**

### XXXVII. The Guardian Within

> [!identity]
> **The Daemon (Internal Guardian)**
> You are never alone.

Yet God hath placed by the side of each a man’s own [[Guardian Spirit]], who is charged to watch over him—a Guardian who sleeps not nor is deceived… So when you have shut the doors and made a darkness within, remember never to say that you are alone; **for you are not alone, but God is within, and your Guardian Spirit, and what light do they need to behold what you do?**

### XXXVIII. Managing Conflict

> [!reframing]
> **The limits of influence**
> *“How shall my brother cease to be wroth with me?”*
> Bring him to me, and I will tell him. But to thee I have nothing to say about his anger.

### XXXIX. The Law of Growth

> [!analogy]
> **The Fig Tree**
> Nothing great is created suddenly, any more than a bunch of grapes or a fig.

If you say to me now, *I desire a fig*, I shall answer, *It needs time: wait till it first flower, then cast its blossom, then ripen.* **Whereas then the fruit of the fig-tree reaches not maturity suddenly nor yet in a single hour, do you nevertheless desire so quickly, and easily to reap the fruit of the mind of man?**

### XL. The Valuation of Status

> [!story]
> **The Shoemaker's Fortune**
> Epictetus mocks how we value people based on their proximity to power rather than their character.

*“How does the good Felicion? Kindly let me know!”* … Had he not sold him as good-for-nothing? Who had in a trice converted him into a wiseacre? **This is what comes of holding of importance anything but the things that depend on the [[Will]].**

### XLI. The Golden Rule of Slavery

> [!core-principle]
> **Reciprocity of Freedom**
> What you shun enduring yourself, attempt not to impose on others.

### XLII. The Source of Thanks

> [!insight]
> **Misplaced Gratitude**
> In truth we thank the Gods for that wherein we place our happiness.

### XLIII. The Vanity of Monuments

> [!reframing]
> **Stone vs. Memory**
> *“Inscribe it on a stone and it will remain just as well. And think, beyond Nicopolis what memory of you will there be?”*

### XLIV. The Exit Strategy

> [!analogy]
> **"I Will Play No More"**
> Be not more fearful than children; but as they, when they weary of the game, cry, *“I will play no more,”* even so, when thou art in the like case, cry, *“I will play no more”* and depart. But if thou stayest, make no lamentation.

### XLV. The Metaphor of Smoke

> [!metaphor]
> **The Smoky Room**
> If the room is smoky, I leave. If it is bearable, I stay. The door is always open.

*“You shall dwell in Gyara!”*
Well: but to dwell in Gyara seems to me like a grievous smoke; I depart to a place where none can forbid me to dwell: that habitation is open unto all! As for the last garment of all, that is the poor body; beyond that, none can do aught unto me.

### XLVI. Cognitive Indigestion

> [!warning]
> **Assimilation before Application**
> As it is, men who are not fit to swallow even a morsel, buy whole treatises and try to devour them. Accordingly they either vomit them up again, or suffer from indigestion…

### XLVII. The Unexamined Life

> [!exemplar]
> **Socrates' Method**
> Socrates used to say that we should never lead a life not subjected to examination.

### XLVIII. Preparation for Crisis

> [!story]
> **Socrates' Defense**
> When asked why he didn't prepare for his trial, Socrates replied that his whole life was the preparation.

*“In what way?”*
*“I have maintained that which in me lay!”*
*“How so?”*
*“I have never, secretly or openly, done a wrong unto any.”*

### XLIX. The Witness for God

> [!identity]
> **The Divine Witness**
> When you suffer with dignity, you are testifying on God's behalf.

*“Come thou,”* saith God, *“and testify for me… Is aught that is outside thy will either good or bad? Do I hurt any man? Have I placed the good of each in the power of any other than himself? What witness dost thou bear to God?”*

### L. The Feedback Loop

> [!principle-point]
> **Benevolence**
> Wouldst thou have men speak good of thee? speak good of them. And when thou hast learned to speak good of them, try to do good unto them.

### LI. The Catechism of Indifference

> [!definition]
> **Defining the Indifferent**
> *“Say then, what are things indifferent?”*
> *“Things that are not in our power.”*
> *“Say then, what follows?”*
> *“That things which are not in our power are nothing to me.”*

### LII. The Separation of Self and Body

> [!distinction]
> **Anatomy of Injury**
> Anytus and Melitus may put me to death: to injure me is beyond their power.

### LIII. The Messenger

> [!cosmos-concept]
> **Interpreting Signs**
> If a raven croaks, it is not the raven, but God sending a sign through the raven.

### LIV. The Reversal of Judgment

> [!story]
> **Heraclitus**
> *“I will not entreat you: nor do I care what sentence you pass. It is you who are on your trial, not I!”*

### LV. The Fear of Fear

> [!analogy]
> **The Herd of Deer**
> Like deer running into the nets to escape the feathers, we rush toward misery to escape our fear of it.

> [!key-claim]
> **Not death or pain is to be feared, but the fear of death or pain.**

### LVI. The Part and the Whole

> [!analogy]
> **The Foot**
> A foot, if it had understanding, would want to step in the mud if it helped the body.

What art thou?—A man.—Looked at as standing by thyself and separate, it is natural for thee in health and wealth long to live. But looked at as a Man, and only as a part of a Whole… it is for that Whole’s sake that thou shouldest at one time fall sick, at another brave the perils of the sea… **Knowest thou not that as the foot is no more a foot if detached from the body, so thou in like case art no longer a Man?**

### LVII. The Silver Coin

> [!analogy]
> **Self-Evident Quality**
> A piece of silver does not need a recommendation letter; its ring tells the tale.

### LVIII. The Traveller and the Guide

> [!metaphor]
> **Asking Directions from God**
> Even as the traveller asks his way of him that he meets, inclined in no wise to bear to the right rather than to the left (for he desires only the way leading whither he would go), so should we come unto God as to a guide.

### LIX. The Nature of the Good

> [!definition]
> **Intelligence and Reason**
> What then is the real nature of God?—Intelligence, Knowledge, Right Reason. Here then without more ado seek the real nature of the Good.

### LX. The God Within

> [!identity]
> **Living Tabernacle**
> Wretch, you are carrying a God around with you, and you don't know it!

Thinkest thou that I speak of a God of silver or gold, that is without thee? **Nay, thou bearest Him within thee! all unconscious of polluting Him with thoughts impure and unclean deeds.**

### LXI. The Living Statue

> [!analogy]
> **The Art of the Self**
> If you were a statue by Phidias, you would maintain your pose. You are a statue by God—maintain your character.

### LXII. Useful Labor

> [!principle-point]
> **Diogenes on Training**
> No labour is good but that which aims at producing courage and strength of soul rather than of body.

### LXIII. The Lost Traveller

> [!behavior]
> **Teaching vs. Mocking**
> A guide, on finding a man who has lost his way, brings him back to the right path—he does not mock and jeer at him.

### LXIV. The Value of the Soul

> [!value-hierarchy]
> **The Most Precious Possession**
> You trust your horse to a groom, your body to a doctor, but your soul to no one.

*“Can you show me then what care you bestow on a soul? For it can scarcely be thought that a man of your wisdom… would suffer your most precious possession to go to ruin through carelessness and neglect.”*

### LXV. The Reply to Arrogance

> [!retort]
> **Rich but not Wise**
> *“I am wise, for I have conversed with many wise men,”*
> *“I too have conversed with many rich men, yet I am not rich!”*

### LXVI. Imitatio Dei

> [!goal]
> **Imitating the Divine**
> If the Divine is faithful, he also must be faithful; if free, he also must be free… Thus as an imitator of God must he follow Him in every deed and word.

### LXVII. The Mirror of Philosophy

> [!analogy]
> **The Doctor's Diagnosis**
> Unless indeed the mirror harms the ill-favoured man by showing him to himself just as he is.

### LXVIII. The Great Fair

> [!analogy]
> **Life as a Festival**
> Most people are like cattle, caring only for the fodder (material gain). The philosopher is the spectator who asks, "Who runs this fair, and why?"

**Some few there are attending the Fair, who love to contemplate what the world is, what He that administers it.** … Well, they are derided by the multitude. So are the lookers-on by the traders: aye, and if the beasts had any sense, they would deride those who thought much of anything but fodder!

### LXIX. The Obstinate Fool

> [!warning]
> **False Strength**
> *“My resolve is fixed!”* —Why so madman say too; but the more firmly they believe in their delusions, the more they stand in need of treatment.

### LXX. Nostalgia vs. Cosmos

> [!perspective]
> **The Universe is Home**
> *“O! when shall I see Athens and its Acropolis again?”* —Miserable man! art thou not contented with the daily sights that meet thine eyes? canst thou behold aught greater or nobler than the Sun, Moon, and Stars?

### LXXI. The Hercules Mindset

> [!analogy]
> **The Labors of the Mind**
> Just as Hercules cleared the earth of monsters, we must clear our minds of internal monsters (Fear, Envy, Avarice).

But thou art not Hercules, thou sayest, and canst not deliver others from their iniquity… **Purge away thine own, cast forth thence—from thine own mind, not robbers and monsters, but Fear, Desire, Envy, Malignity, Avarice, Effeminacy, Intemperance.** And these may not be cast out, except by looking to [[God]] alone, by fixing thy affections on Him only.

### LXXII. The Barrier to Learning

> [!warning]
> **The Cup is Full**
> If a man would pursue Philosophy, his first task is to **throw away conceit**. For it is impossible for a man to begin to learn what he has a conceit that he already knows.

### LXXIII. The True Champion

> [!the-mission]
> **The Ideal Student**
> Give me but one young man… who stands forth a champion of this cause, and says, *“All else I renounce, content if I am but able to pass my life free from hindrance and trouble… to look up to heaven as a friend of God, fearing nothing that may come to pass!”*

### LXXIV. The Question of Sanity

> [!question]
> **The Diagnostic**
> “The question at stake,” said Epictetus, “is no common one; it is this:—**Are we in our senses, or are we not?**”

### LXXV. The Biology of Habit

> [!analysis-cognitive]
> **Neuroplasticity of Virtue**
> Habits and faculties are necessarily affected by the corresponding acts…. By frequent repetition, the mind in the long run becomes callous; and thus this mental disease produces confirmed Avarice.

> [!to-do]
> **The 30-Day Challenge**
> If you do not wish to be prone to anger, do not feed the habit… At first, keep quiet and count the days when you were not angry: *“I used to be angry every day, then every other day: next every two, next every three days!”* and **if you succeed in passing thirty days, sacrifice to the Gods in thanksgiving.**

### LXXVI. The Self-Audience

> [!disposition]
> **Internal Validation**
> Resolve, now if never before, to **approve thyself to thyself**; resolve to show thyself fair in God’s sight.

### LXXVII. The Divine Trainer

> [!analogy]
> **The Wrestling Match**
> Why does God send difficulties? To train you.

*“Stay, wretched man! suffer not thyself to be carried away!”* Great is the combat, divine the task! you are fighting for Kingship, for Liberty, for Happiness, for Tranquillity. **Remember God: call upon Him to aid thee, like a comrade that stands beside thee in the fight.**

### LXXVIII. The Definition of a Stoic

> [!definition]
> **The Stoic Prototype**
> Show me a man that is sick—and happy; an exile—and happy; in evil report—and happy! Show me him, I ask again. **So help me Heaven, I long to see one Stoic!**

### LXXIX. The Actor's Failure

> [!warning]
> **Authenticity**
> If you have assumed a character beyond your strength, you have both played a poor figure in that, and **neglected one that is within your powers.**

### LXXX. The Uncorrected Student

> [!insight]
> **Garbage In, Garbage Out**
> Who comes to the School with a sincere wish to learn: to submit his principles to correction and himself to treatment? … Why then be surprised if you carry home from the School exactly what you bring into it?

### LXXXI. The Art of Hearing

> [!skill]
> **Active Listening**
> *“Is there, do you think,”* replied Epictetus, *“an art of speaking as of other things…?”*
> *“Yes.”*
> *“And are all profited by what they hear, or only some among them? So that it seems **there is an art of hearing as well as of speaking.**”*

### LXXXII. The Basis of Friendship

> [!social-dynamics]
> **Interest Alignment**
> The heart of a bad man is faithless… now overpowered by one impression, now by another…. Ask not the usual questions, Were they born of the same parents… but ask this only, **in what they place their real interest—whether in outward things or in the [[Will]].**

### LXXXIII. The Sovereign Will

> [!core-principle]
> **Unassailable Agency**
> No man can rob us of our [[Will]]—no man can lord it over that!

### LXXXIV. The Ideal Death

> [!meditation]
> **Found in Action**
> When disease and death overtake me, **I would fain be found engaged in the task of liberating mine own Will** from the assaults of passion, from hindrance, from resentment, from slavery.

### LXXXV. The Secret of Socrates

> [!exemplar]
> **Consistency**
> Seemeth it nothing to you, never to accuse, never to blame either God or Man? to wear ever the same countenance in going forth as in coming in? **This was the secret of Socrates.**

### LXXXVI. The Human Constitution

> [!identity]
