> ### From Singularity to Standard Model: The Evidentiary Journey of the Big Bang 🌌
> **Scope & Angle:** This topic traces the development of the Big Bang theory not as a static fact, but as a scientific model that evolved over time, focusing on the key observational pillars—like cosmic expansion and primordial element abundances—that cemented its acceptance. It moves beyond a simple definition to explore the intellectual journey of cosmology itself.
>
> **Engineered Input for Gem:** `A Comprehensive Exposition on the Theoretical Development and Observational Evidence of the Big Bang Model, from Hubble's Law and Nucleosynthesis to the Cosmic Microwave Background`

> [!topic-idea]
> ### Einstein's Canvas: General Relativity as the Language of Cosmology 📜
> **Scope & Angle:** This topic explores how Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity is not just a theory of gravity, but the fundamental mathematical and conceptual framework for modern cosmology, shaping our entire understanding of spacetime, its curvature, and the universe's large-scale evolution. It focuses on the "why" behind our cosmological equations.

> [!topic-idea]
> ### The Echo of Creation: Decoding the Cosmic Microwave Background 🛰️
> **Scope & Angle:** This topic provides an in-depth look at the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation, explaining its origin as the Big Bang's afterglow and, more importantly, how its minute temperature fluctuations serve as a blueprint for all subsequent cosmic structure. It treats the CMB as the most important data set in cosmology.

> ### Solving the Universe's Puzzles: The Essential Role of Cosmic Inflation ⏱️

 **Scope & Angle:** This explores the concept of cosmic inflation as a critical addendum to the standard Big Bang theory, explaining how this brief, hyper-accelerated expansion in the first fraction of a second elegantly resolves fundamental cosmological problems like the horizon and flatness problems.
