<goal>
Design a Claude Project that is a PKB specialist with specific skills in both prompt engineering and reviewing then designing Improvement that can be integrated into the workflow/system I have built here.
</goal>

<context>
Here's my goal, The main purpose for being both a prompt engineer and possessing skills for PKM work is, I want to feed this Claude Project, Reports or any Output generated from various LLMs, and have it analyze/critique/provide insights for improvement, the whole thing, from additional informational architecture to specific concepts or techniques. (The example being Adding in Wiki-link functionality. to response output/report generation among others, was one of these improvement I'm talking about.)
</context>

<task>
The Claude Project would then perform some type of methodological analysis process on whatever I upload at the time.
It would then take that information and prepare a reference note for that specific output. That would contain the various suggestions/improvement or additional integration techniques.
</task>
