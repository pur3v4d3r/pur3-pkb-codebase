#### *Full Daily Quote's*


> [!stoic-quote] Stoic Quote
>  "Remember that it is not only the desire of having, but also the desire of avoiding, that is subject to our will. Remember that you are a mortal, and one of the parts of a whole. Remember that the nature of the things which you desire is not your own, but foreign. Remember that as soon as an impression [phantasia] arises, say to it: 'You are just an impression and not at all the thing you claim to be.' Then examine it by those rules which you have, and first and chiefly, by this: whether it relates to the things which are in our power, or to those which are not; and, if it relates to anything not in our power, be prepared to say: 'It is nothing to me.'"
>  	—— Epictetus, 
>  	    Discourses [Book II, Chapter 18]


> [!stoic-quote] Stoic Quote
> “Men are disturbed not by things, but by the views which they take of things. Thus, death is nothing terrible, else it would have appeared so to Socrates. But the terror consists in our notion of death, that it is terrible. When, therefore, we are hindered, or disturbed, or grieved, let us never impute it to others, but to ourselves; that is, to our own views. It is the action of an uninstructed person to reproach others for his own misfortunes; of one entering upon instruction, to reproach himself; and one perfectly instructed, to reproach neither others nor himself.”
> 	 —— Epictetus, 
> 	    Enchiridion (Handbook), Section V



### Wednesday, December 3rd, 2025's Plan
> [!purpose] The One Thing to Remember
> *When something disturbing happens*, ***immediately ask*** "**Is this something I can control or something I cannot control?**" If it's something you cannot control (which includes most of what happens), then struggling against it, resenting it, or being emotionally devastated by it is irrational—you're expending energy trying to change what cannot be changed. Your only rational response is **acceptance** of the fact and **focus** on what remains within your power: how you interpret the event, what meaning you assign it, and what actions you choose to take in response.

### Task Workbench (Todays-Planning)

- [ ] 
- Fix Task Queries on Scratchpad and Daily Note
- Add Stoic Journal to Daily Note
- Review the Review system to determine whether placement is necessary. I would like to see at least a weekly review. One where you review the daily journals.
	- Maybe Space Repetition
	- Start small build to bigger things.


### Tomorrow's Priority

- [<] {{PRIORITY TOMORROW HERE}} [scheduled:: 2025-12-04] [created:: 2025-12-03]

### Morning

- **Prospective Visualization**: 
	- [What challenges might today present?] Anxiety will be an issue with it having happened yesterday and the day before. 
	- [How do I want to respond?] I have to remember the Dichotomy of Control. What is in my power? Dont struggle against things that are not.

- **Virtue Intention**: 
	- [Which specific virtue will I emphasize today?] Temperance, I will display self mastery when time comes to deal with anxiety. I will show this by using my training and employing the Dichotomy of Control. I will ask myself "*Is this something that is in my control or not?*" and if it is note I am prepared to say to it "*You are nothing to me*"
		- [Wisdom], [Justice], [Courage], [Temperance]

- **Control Dichotomy**: 
	- [What is within versus outside my control today?] Anxiety is not within in my control. Others emotions and responses to my stimuli are not within my control.

- **Implementation Intentions**: 
	- [If [specific situation], then I will [specific response]]. If anxiety occurs my response will be to simpley recite the Dichotomy of Control.


### Evening

- **Event Documentation**: 
- [What significant events occurred?]
	- [Factual recording]

- **Judgment Analysis**: 
	- [What interpretations/judgments did I make?] 
		- [Were they based on what's controllable?]

- **Emotional Inventory**: 
	- [When did I experience strong emotions?] 
		- [What thoughts generated them?]

- **Virtue Assessment**: 
	- [Did I act according to my morning intention?] 
		- [Where did I succeed or fail?]

- **Cognitive Reframing**: 
	- [Select one problematic reaction and systematically reframe using Stoic principles.]

- **Lesson Extraction**: 
	- [What did I learn today about myself, others, or effective action?]
