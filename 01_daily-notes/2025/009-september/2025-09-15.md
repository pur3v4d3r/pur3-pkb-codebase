	- What challenges do you anticipate?  How can you approach them with patience and creativity? Handling situation of first contact with each parent. Mom is going to be difficult because she already has strong negative feelings, harboring toward almost, resentment of me. So I need to approach this situation with caution and really attempt to control me behavioral traits. They must not become a distraction from the real goal of connecting emotionally with her. Dad is going to be a challenge for me ,as he doesn't express himself well Either. And all of us lack the communicational maturity to push past the awkwardness and actually communicate.
