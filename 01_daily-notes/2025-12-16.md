#### *Full Daily Quote's*
> [!stoic-quote] ### Stoic Quote
>  "Remember that it is not only the desire of having, but also the desire of avoiding, that is subject to our will. Remember that you are a mortal, and one of the parts of a whole. Remember that the nature of the things which you desire is not your own, but foreign. Remember that as soon as an impression [phantasia] arises, say to it: 'You are just an impression and not at all the thing you claim to be.' Then examine it by those rules which you have, and first and chiefly, by this: whether it relates to the things which are in our power, or to those which are not; and, if it relates to anything not in our power, be prepared to say: 'It is nothing to me.'"
>  	—— Epictetus, 
>  	    Discourses [Book II, Chapter 18]



> [!purpose] ### The One Thing to Remember
> *When something disturbing happens*, ***immediately ask*** "**Is this something I can control or something I cannot control?**" If it's something you cannot control (which includes most of what happens), then struggling against it, resenting it, or being emotionally devastated by it is irrational—you're expending energy trying to change what cannot be changed. Your only rational response is **acceptance** of the fact and **focus** on what remains within your power: how you interpret the event, what meaning you assign it, and what actions you choose to take in response.

> 🖥️**Log-Entry**:: Learned that in order to have LLM stay consistant with output especially since updates are rather fequent and can be disruptive to workflows. The lesson was that in order to continue with my high quality outoputs, I need to stop thinking of it as a ernter one prompt and done situation. The new situation has evleved Im guessing from the popularity of Agentic Use. Instead of the one and done method the best appoarch as of now is to do this iterativley, or sequencially. So, I have started a project to learn and employ these new prompt engineering techniques.

> 🖥️**Log-Entry**:: Got Claude set up with an official system prompt. I also had claude start logging everything we do in the PKb. The location of all this information is stored in this folder -> 00-meta. This does two things I see right away. [1] This instanly gives claude a memory. [2] This (over-time0 provides many glorious atributes to potentially harvest, such as imporved metacognition . Having a running log that is rather aoutonomous it both Cognitiveley Load bear freeing and saves tremendous time and effort.

Atm Claude has a Quota of 0 over there so the model is activated however no messages can be sent. I have asked for quota increses and await the answer.
