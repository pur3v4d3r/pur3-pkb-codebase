# Always **Ask Yourself**

---
*Steps for Success*
**"How can I respond to this situation in accordance with my character and values?"**
*Does this impression correctly identify what is good, evil, or indifferent? More specifically, does it attribute value to something within my control or beyond it?*
- **Absolutely Controllable**: My beliefs, values, desires, aversions, intentions, efforts, character, use of reason
- **Influenced But Not Controlled**: Outcomes of my actions, others' responses, future events, health, circumstances
- **Completely Uncontrollable**: Past events, others' opinions and choices, natural phenomena, fate, mortality

> "The chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to myself which are externals not under my control, and which have to do with the choices I actually control."

> "A man who suffers before it is necessary, suffers more than is necessary. Let your mind meet the difficulty with its full force; always anticipate the blows."

# ALWAYS **READ** THESE **LOOPS EVERYDAY**

>[!thoughts] **Reinforcing Loop 1**: *The Insight Compounding Loop*
>
> - **Loop Identifier**:: [[Insight Compounding Loop]]
> 	- **The causal chain**:: *More Notes* → *More Potential Connections* → *Easier Integration of New Ideas* → *More Notes*.
> 	- **Insight**:: This is a reinforcing loop with a delay—the benefits don't appear instantly, but compound over time.

>[!thoughts] **Reinforcing Loop 2**: *The Retrieval Practice Loop*
>
> - **Loop Identifier**:: [[Retrieval Practice Loop]]
> 	- **The causal chain**:: *Retrieve a Note* → *Strengthen Memory of That Note* → *Easier to Retrieve in Future* → *Retrieve More Often*.
> 	- **Insight**:: A second reinforcing loop that operates through the mechanism of [[Retrieval Practice|retrieval]]

>[!thoughts] **Reinforcing Loop 3**: *The Motivation and Confidence Loop*
>
> - **Loop Identifier**:: [[Motivation and Confidence Loop]]
> 	- **The causal chain**:: *Use PKB Successfully* → *Increased Confidence and Motivation* → *More Frequent Use* → *Better PKB Quality* → *More Success*.
> 	- **Insight**:: A third, more psychological reinforcing loop governs your *engagement* with the system.

> [!analysis-cognitive] **Balancing Loop 1**: *The Cognitive Load Regulation Loop*
>
> - *Loop Identifier*:: [[Cognitive Load Regulation Loop]]
> 	- *The causal chain*:: **Number of Notes Increases** → **Complexity and Search Difficulty Increase** → **Cognitive Load Rises** → **Engagement Decreases** → **Growth Slows**.
> 	- *Insight*:: This is a protective balancing loop—it prevents the system from growing so fast that it collapses under its own weight.

> [!analysis-cognitive] **Balancing Loop 2**: *The Time Allocation Loop*
>
> - *Loop Identifier*:: [[Time Allocation Loop]]
> 	- *The causal chain*:: **Time Spent on PKB Increases** → **Time Pressure Increases** → **Prioritization Away from PKB** → **Time Spent Decreases**.
> 	- *Insight*:: This balancing loop explains the common failure mode of over-engineering. When practitioners become obsessed with **perfecting** the system—creating elaborate folder structures, color-coding tags, writing lengthy metadata—they often burn out and abandon the PKB entirely. The system consumes more time than it saves.

> [!analysis-cognitive] **Balancing Loop 3**: *The Relevance Decay Loop*
>
> - *Loop Identifier*:: [[Relevance Decay Loop]]
> 	- *The causal chain*:: **Notes Age** → **Relevance Decreases** → **Perceived Clutter Increases** → **Pruning Behavior Increases** → **Number of Irrelevant Notes Decreases**.
> 	- *Insight*:: This loop is essential for system health. A PKB without decay becomes a digital landfill. The challenge is to **automate** or **systematize** the pruning process so it doesn't require conscious effort.

> 🖥️**Log-Entry**:: Ive notice (through [[Metacognition]]) that I seem to be having some difficulty in A) concentrating/Focusing, and B) Having a difficult time thinking activley. My hypothesis is this: I belive that this has something to do with [[Cognitive Load Theory]] So this is the Plan Im stopping everything and reduceing the cognitive load by first planning out a strategy for fixing the many prject that open at the momnet and cause this cognitive burden that Im exsperienceing.
