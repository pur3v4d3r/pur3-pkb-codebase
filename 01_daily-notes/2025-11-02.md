> **Capture**:: Perhaps the deepest mystery in cosmology concerns the nature of [[Dark Energy]]—the mysterious component driving cosmic acceleration. Is it truly Einstein's cosmological constant, with a perfectly constant energy density that does not dilute as the universe expands? Or is it something more exotic—a dynamical [[scalar field]] (sometimes called [[quintessence]]) whose properties evolve over time?

> **Capture**:: While cosmic inflation provides elegant solutions to several cosmological puzzles, the theory itself raises deep questions. What is the [[inflaton field]] that drove inflation? What triggered inflation to start? What caused it to end? How did the inflaton decay into the ordinary matter and radiation that filled the post-inflationary universe?

> **Capture**:: Moreover, some versions of inflation predict eternal, ongoing inflation in most regions of space, with "pocket universes" like ours forming as rare bubbles where inflation has ended—a concept called [[eternal inflation]] or the [[multiverse]].
