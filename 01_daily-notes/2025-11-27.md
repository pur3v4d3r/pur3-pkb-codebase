You are going to try new things with this like:

Desighing the project to be a foundational Report Generator with knowledge of Dataview/Meta-bind, It uses this knowledge to desighn and build reports that are portentialy interactive.
This is just one idea from when I was reading we can easily think of more or even have the LLM's brainstorm for this.
