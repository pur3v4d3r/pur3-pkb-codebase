*After the success I wrote this, it has had ZERO revision. However, I may work on this some more as this unfolds.*


> [!thoughts]
> ## Get back on the right sleep pattern.
> 
> ### To do this:
> 
> Take your medicine at 3:00AM **DO NOT** Listen to that voice saying to take it ahead of time. *I don't want to*. That's your negative [[Schemas]] acknowledging you are trying to change. It doesn't want you to change, because its autonomous action and it likes routine. **You have to** break out of the various loops and cycles your mind has been stuck in, tonight showed that.
> 
> It's all about **How reality is perceived**. By *not* taking my thoughts as reality I *was able* to re-direct my thinking in the **right direction**. That *right direction* is **reality**. To do this you use a tool like the **Dichotomy of Control**. It's not about controlling anything. It's a tool used to force yourself into thinking a *different way*. To try to pull yourself away from the *false reality*, you've constructed in your mind and toward the actual reality. 
> 
> You've constructed a **false reality** from these **negative thoughts** which are *autonomous* in nature, you've engrained them into your [[Schemas|Schemas]] and now they have become literally automatic. They are *deceptive*, **they control you in away in which you do not see**. You get *stuck* in a cycle of **repetition**. Where in by engaging with these *negative thoughts* you will inadvertently begin to intermingle your intentional thoughts with them. By doing this you can no longer tell which is which, and start to believe in this *false realty*. Which you yourself have constructed. When you engage with these automatic thoughts you are engraining these thought deeper into your mind. The way to get away from this is the *tool* I spoke about, which is the **Dichotomy of Control** when you change your thoughts to something else and realize that you've been thinking illogically by perceiving a reality that your mind has entirely constructed, because your feel about things in which the way you see them. This in turn becomes a habitualized loop whereby simple having these negative thoughts play in your mind continuously you inevitably will start to think that is the reality, because, making you to in turn feel worse, which is another loop.
> 
> Negative self talk is deceptive in this regard. It controls everything.
