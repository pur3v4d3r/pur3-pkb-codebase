**Capture**:: Following this inscrutable earliest moment, many cosmologists believe the universe underwent a brief period of extraordinary expansion called [[Cosmic Inflation]]. During this inflationary epoch (roughly 10⁻³⁶ to 10⁻³² seconds after the Big Bang), the universe expanded by a factor of at least 10²⁶—growing from smaller than an atom to perhaps the size of a grapefruit—in an incomprehensibly brief instant.[^11] This exponential expansion was driven by a [[scalar field]] (often called the [[inflaton]]) whose energy density remained nearly constant as the universe expanded, creating a repulsive gravitational effect.
