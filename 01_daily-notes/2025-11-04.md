> - *The development of critical thinking* **strongly connects to:**
>     - [[Epistemic Cognition]] and [[reflective judgment]]
>     - **The reason:**
>         - Epistemic cognition refers to individuals' understanding of the nature of knowledge and knowing—their beliefs about what constitutes truth, how knowledge is justified, and how competing claims should be evaluated. Mature epistemic cognition recognizes that knowledge is constructed, evidence-based, and subject to revision—a fundamentally metacognitive perspective. The development from naive epistemological beliefs ("knowledge is certain facts handed down by authorities") to sophisticated epistemic understanding ("knowledge is constructed through systematic inquiry and critical evaluation of evidence") requires metacognitive reflection on the nature of one's own beliefs and how they are justified. Critical thinking instruction that incorporates metacognitive components helps students develop not just better reasoning skills but better understanding of reasoning itself as a human enterprise subject to biases, limitations, and the need for systematic methodological safeguards.
