TASK 
WHERE "!"
WHERE created = date(this-week)
LIMIT 10
SORT created DESC
```

```

### Task Workbench (Todays-Planning)

#### While Working
*Reading*
*Filing*
- Go through and organize the files, File anything out of place.
*Naming-Convention*

- [ ] *MOC*
- [x] *Permanent Note System*  [completion:: 2025-11-25]
	- Read through the report generated from Claude on a new system for my Permanent Notes.
		- Extract key ideas for use in your system.
- [x] *Templates*  [completion:: 2025-11-25]
	- You need to get the whole Template situation under control again.
	- There are various versions of the same Template in the folder for Template move them to archive.
		- Create a template Archive
	- You need to ensure that we have a capture system in place that works.
		- Must be quick and simple
		- Use a simple template and 1-2 tags and aliases when creating the permanent note
			- It should have all the necessary section in place.
			- Then when you come back to file it you will apply the real YAML using a template.
				- That has the entire Templater Structure.

Fix the Gems and Project with new and correct Exemplar.

Use the moethod you learned last night where each template is a choice in the macro.
The macro is the trigger.
When you trigger the macro it provides you with the choices youve registered in quickadd as choices.
You then choose the choice to create which ever note.
Quickadd uses the correct corresponding template and creates the note you wanted, in the folder you want.
You go through the prompt and suggesters for Templater to execute the template instuctions so you can choose tags and such.]  [⏳:: 2025-11-26] [] [⏫/🔼/🔽/⏬) or leave blank?] [🔗:: [[reference-guide-designing-optimal-workflows-&-sops-20251125160849]]]

> **Capture**:: [[Epictetus]]'s instruction to address distressing thoughts by saying "You are just an impression and not at all the thing you claim to be." This technique, which contemporary [[Acceptance and Commitment Therapy|Acceptance and Commitment Therapy]] calls *cognitive defusion*, leverages the brain's capacity for [[Metacognition|metacognitive awareness]]—the ability to observe one's own mental processes as objects of awareness rather than identifying with them completely.

> **Capture**:: We fulfill our nature not by pursuing pleasure or accumulating external goods, but by **developing excellent character** and exercising our rational faculties in service of appropriate action. This is why Epictetus could insist, even as a former slave with a permanent physical disability, that he possessed everything necessary for human flourishing—because what truly matters lies within the domain of choice and judgment, which no external force can touch without our complicity.

> **Capture**:: The Stoics recognized that emotional disturbance results from errors in judgment—from assenting to false or confused impressions—and therefore that mental health requires developing the capacity to analyze our thoughts with precision before accepting them as true.

> **Capture**:: how do we distinguish true impressions from false ones? Zeno's answer was the concept of the **cognitive impression** (*phantasia kataleptike*)—an impression that (1) arises from what exists, (2) accurately represents what exists, and (3) is so clear and distinctive that it could not be confused with a false impression. When we encounter such an impression and give our **assent** (*synkatathesis*) to it, we acquire knowledge.
