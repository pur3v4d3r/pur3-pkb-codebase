*Applied to Self Education*:
Pragmatism
Constructivism
Self Determination Theory
Self Regulation Theory


Look into:
[[Rumination]], 
How does this Occur?
What are the leading factors that can start a [[Rumination|ruminative]] episode?
How does one use [[Dichotomy of Control]] to combat [[Rumination]] and [[Automatic negative thoughts]] about oneself and things they can't control?
How does [[Rumination]] and [[Negative Self Talk]] connect with [[Default Mode Network]]?

How do you successfully construct schemas and then build the neural pathways?
Pragmatism Constructivism and Stoicism

Quick Capture Stoicism Dichotomy of Control 
Daily Note Remember to Classify everything as controllable or not controllable.

```

## 📥 Situation/Challenge
[Describe what happened or what you're facing]

## 🎯 Control Analysis

**Entirely Within My Control:**
- My interpretation/judgment:
- My response/action:
- My effort allocation:

**Partially Within My Control:**
- What I can influence:
- What I must accept:
- Boundary between the two:

**Entirely Outside My Control:**
- [List and explicitly acknowledge]
- Acceptance statement: "This is not within my control. I accept it as it is."

## ⚡ Action Items (Controllable Only)
- [ ] [Specific action on controllable variable]
- [ ] [Specific action on controllable aspect of partial-control variable]

## 🧘 Practice
What am I wasting cognitive resources on that lies outside
```
