#### *Full Daily Quote's*
> “Men are disturbed not by things, but by the views which they take of things. Thus, death is nothing terrible, else it would have appeared so to Socrates. But the terror consists in our notion of death, that it is terrible. When, therefore, we are hindered, or disturbed, or grieved, let us never impute it to others, but to ourselves; that is, to our own views. It is the action of an uninstructed person to reproach others for his own misfortunes; of one entering upon instruction, to reproach himself; and one perfectly instructed, to reproach neither others nor himself.”
> 	 —— Epictetus, 
> 	    Enchiridion (Handbook), Section V

> "Remember that it is not only the desire of having, but also the desire of avoiding, that is subject to our will. Remember that you are a mortal, and one of the parts of a whole. Remember that the nature of the things which you desire is not your own, but foreign. Remember that as soon as an impression [phantasia] arises, say to it: 'You are just an impression and not at all the thing you claim to be.' Then examine it by those rules which you have, and first and chiefly, by this: whether it relates to the things which are in our power, or to those which are not; and, if it relates to anything not in our power, be prepared to say: 'It is nothing to me.'"
> 	—— Epictetus, 
> 	    Discourses [Book II, Chapter 18]

# Tasks Overview
> [!task-metrics]
> **Total Tasks**: `= length(this.file.tasks)`
> **Completed Tasks**: `= length(filter(this.file.tasks, (t) => t.completed))`
> **Pending Tasks**: `= length(filter(this.file.tasks, (t) => !t.completed))`
> **Completion Rate**: `= choice(length(this.file.tasks) > 0, round((length(filter(this.file.tasks, (t) => t.completed)) / length(this.file.tasks)) * 100) + "%", "No tasks")`
### Can Do Today
```dataview
TASK 
WHERE "!"
WHERE created = date(this-week)
LIMIT 10
SORT created DESC
```
### Completed Today
```dataview
TASK
FROM "01_daily-notes"
WHERE completed AND completion = this.file.day
```

### Task Workbench (Todays-Planning)

- [ ] **Daily Note Update**
	- [ ] Run the prompt for the daily template.
		- [ ] `Note` Run this through the prompt engineer first to see what it says you can improve.
- [ ] **Templates Organizing**
	- [ ] Archive unusable templates
	- [ ] Fix naming convention/ensure naming convention is consistent.
	- [ ] Change QuickAdd template folder to Templater. (Is still bothersome.)
		- `Note` I've decided to keep for now as continuously switching folder locations is not good for muscle memory and such.
	- [ ]  Search older prompts for any on QuickAdd or QuickAdd Macro. Something you can modify for QuickAdd macro generation.
- [ ] **QuickAdd Fix/Macros**
	- [ ] Ensure all choices are in working order
- [ ] **Automation**
	- DataviewJs
		- [ ] Design a prompt for having Obsidian Automations Claude Project generate these.
			- Design so it can be re-usable, or done multiple times in a row.
			- [ ] Try it out with Google and `Local LLMS`
- *Work with Local LLMS More*.
