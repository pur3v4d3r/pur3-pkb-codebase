## Lessons Learned & Evolving Principles

### Infrastructure Insights
**"Foundation-first is non-negotiable"**
- Attempting domain work before infrastructure stability creates compounding friction
- 70/30 split (infrastructure/content) validated through experience
- System quality directly determines knowledge quality
- Premature optimization is real, but so is premature content creation

**"Cognitive load from organization exceeds cognitive load from complexity"**
- Decision fatigue from poor systems > inherent difficulty of material
- Automation and standardization are force multipliers
- Consistency enforcement through templates prevents decision proliferation
- Progressive revelation (577 → 25-40 tags) dramatically reduces mental overhead

### Automation Principles
**"Plugin synergies create emergent capabilities"**
- Dataview + Templater ≠ addition, it's multiplication
- Self-documenting systems arise from well-designed integrations
- Zero-maintenance automation is achievable through recursive patterns
- Community-discovered patterns often exceed official documentation

**"Perfect is the enemy of started, but shipped beats perfect"**
- Iterative deployment with monitoring > big-bang perfection
- Real-world usage reveals optimization opportunities
- Sandbox testing prevents catastrophic failures
- Rollback capabilities enable confident experimentation

### Knowledge Work Insights
**"The graph grows itself when systems are right"**
- Well-designed templates encourage linking naturally
- Dataview queries discover connections automatically
- MOC dashboards surface synthesis opportunities
- Review cycles maintain graph health without manual intervention

**"Maturity is a journey, not a destination"**
- Notes evolve continuously (seedling → evergreen → wilting → revised)
- Acceptance of imperfection enables progress
- Regular review prevents knowledge decay
- Evergreen status is maintained, not achieved once
