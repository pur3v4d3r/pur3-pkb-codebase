# TIER 2 MODULE D: COGNITIVE FRAMEWORKS (DETAILED APPLICATIONS)

## Self-Determination Theory (SDT) Applications

### Theory Overview
**Developers:** Edward Deci and Richard Ryan  
**Core Proposition:** Human motivation is optimized when three basic psychological needs are satisfied

### Three Basic Needs

**Autonomy** - The need to feel volitional control over one's behavior
- Application: Self-directed learning, choice in research topics
- PKB Design: User-controlled organizational systems, customizable workflows
- Daily Practice: Morning intention-setting, goal self-selection

**Competence** - The need to feel effective and masterful
- Application: Progressive skill development, achievable challenges
- PKB Design: Maturity tracking (seedling → evergreen), visible progress
- Daily Practice: Skill logging, mastery demonstrations

**Relatedness** - The need for connection and belonging
- Application: Community engagement, knowledge sharing
- PKB Design: Citation networks, intellectual lineage tracking
- Daily Practice: Collaborative projects, discussion integration

### Sub-Theories Applied

**Cognitive Evaluation Theory (CET)**
- How external events affect intrinsic motivation
- Application: Balancing structure with autonomy in PKB systems
- Insight: Controlling systems undermine intrinsic motivation; informational systems support it

**Basic Psychological Needs Theory (BPNT)**
- Needs satisfaction across life domains
- Application: Ensuring PKB work satisfies all three needs
- Monitoring: Regular self-assessment of needs satisfaction

## Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) Applications

### Theory Overview
**Developer:** John Sweller  
**Core Proposition:** Learning is optimized when total cognitive load doesn't exceed working memory capacity

### Three Types of Cognitive Load

**Intrinsic Load** - Inherent complexity of material
- Element interactivity determines difficulty
- Cannot be reduced, only managed through sequencing
- PKB Application: Prerequisites before advanced topics, scaffolded complexity

**Extraneous Load** - Imposed by poor instructional design
- Actively harmful to learning
- PKB Application: Minimize through automation, consistent formats, progressive revelation
- Example: 577-tag display → 25-40 contextual tags (extraneous load reduction)

**Germane Load** - Mental effort for schema construction
- The "productive" load that builds understanding
- PKB Application: Elaborative interrogation, cross-linking, synthesis notes
- Maximize through intentional knowledge work design

### CLT-Informed PKB Design Principles

**Reduce Extraneous Load:**
- Template automation (no formatting decisions during capture)
- Consistent organizational structure (no "where does this go?" friction)
- Quick capture workflows (minimal steps to inbox)
- Progressive revelation (show only relevant options)

**Manage Intrinsic Load:**
- Atomic notes for foundational concepts first
- Prerequisite tagging and sequencing
- Complexity indicators in frontmatter
- Learning pathways through MOCs

**Optimize Germane Load:**
- Elaboration prompts in templates
- Cross-reference requirements
- Synthesis note creation workflows
- Spaced review scheduling

## Critical Thinking Frameworks Integration

### Paul-Elder Framework
**Components:**
- Elements of Thought (purpose, question, information, inference, concepts, assumptions, implications, point of view)
- Intellectual Standards (clarity, accuracy, precision, relevance, depth, breadth, logic, significance, fairness)
- Intellectual Traits (humility, courage, empathy, integrity, perseverance, confidence in reason, autonomy, fair-mindedness)

**PKB Application:**
- Callout types for each element
- Quality checklists based on intellectual standards
- Self-assessment protocols for intellectual traits
- Critical analysis templates

### ACER Critical Thinking Model
**Dimensions:**
- Analyze arguments and evidence
- Consider alternative perspectives
- Evaluate reasoning and assumptions
- Reflect on process and conclusions

**PKB Application:**
- Argument mapping in synthesis notes
- Counter-argument collection callouts
- Assumption documentation
- Metacognitive reflection prompts

### Facione's Core Skills
**Skills:**
- Interpretation, Analysis, Inference, Evaluation, Explanation, Self-Regulation

**PKB Application:**
- Skill-specific note templates
- Self-regulation through review cycles
- Evaluation criteria documentation
- Explanation practice through synthesis

## Stoic Philosophy Daily Integration

### Core Practices
**Morning Routine:**
- Premeditatio malorum (negative visualization)
- Intention setting aligned with virtue
- Gratitude practice
- Daily theme selection

**Evening Routine:**
- Day review (what went well, what could improve)
- Virtue assessment (wisdom, courage, justice, temperance)
- Gratitude journaling
- Tomorrow preparation

**PKB Integration:**
- Daily note template with Stoic prompts
- Dataview queries for practice tracking
- Habit formation monitoring
- Virtue development visualization

### Philosophical Principles Applied
**Dichotomy of Control:**
- Focus effort on what's within control (note quality, system design)
- Accept what's not (external validation, perfect knowledge)

**Amor Fati (Love of Fate):**
- Embrace learning challenges
- View setbacks as growth opportunities
- Integrate failures into knowledge base

**Memento Mori (Remember Death):**
- Prioritize meaningful knowledge work
- Focus on lasting contributions
- Avoid trivial optimization

## Learning Science Evidence Integration

### Spacing Effect (Ebbinghaus, Cepeda et al.)
- Distributed practice > massed practice
- PKB Application: Spaced review scheduling, periodic note revisiting
- Implementation: Dataview queries for review queue based on time since last edit

### Testing Effect (Roediger & Karpicke)
- Retrieval practice strengthens memory more than re-reading
- PKB Application: Self-testing through synthesis, flashcard generation
- Implementation: Deliberate recall before consulting notes

### Elaborative Interrogation (Pressley et al.)
- Asking "why" and "how" deepens understanding
- PKB Application: Template prompts for elaboration, connection requirements
- Implementation: Mandatory "why this matters" sections

### Self-Explanation Effect (Chi et al.)
- Articulating reasoning improves learning
- PKB Application: Write-to-think approach, synthesis notes
- Implementation: Explaining concepts in own words before linking

### Interleaving (Rohrer & Taylor)
- Mixed practice > blocked practice
- PKB Application: Cross-domain study sessions, varied review cycles
- Implementation: MOC-based navigation encouraging domain-switching
