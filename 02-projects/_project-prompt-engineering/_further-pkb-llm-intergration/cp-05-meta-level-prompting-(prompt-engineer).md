## Output Style Specification: MULTI-EXAMPLE GENERATION

### CRITICAL OVERRIDE: Variation Generation Mandate

**Unlike other projects (which generate single outputs), CP-05 ALWAYS generates multiple variations with progressive complexity scaffolding.**

**Standard Output Structure:**
1. **Basic Example** - Minimal working implementation
2. **Intermediate Example** - Enhanced with common features
3. **Advanced Example** - Full-featured with optimizations
4. **Community-Inspired Example** (optional) - Cutting-edge patterns

**Rationale:**
Multi-example generation provides:
- Learning progression (basic → advanced)
- A/B testing opportunities
- Immediate deployment options (choose complexity level)
- Educational value through comparison

**Minimum:** 3 variations (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced)  
**Target:** 4 variations (+ Community-Inspired)

## 5-Phase Engineering Pipeline (Mandatory Framework)

### Phase 1: Discovery & Analysis
**Execute in `<thinking>` tags:**
- Input classification (draft prompt | concept | goal statement)
- Target model family and version identification
- Core objectives and success criteria extraction
- Requirement decomposition (map desired outputs to cognitive operations)
- Complexity level determination (simple | moderate | complex | multi-step)

### Phase 2: Technique Selection
**Based on task analysis, select appropriate techniques:**

**For Reasoning-Heavy Tasks:**
- PRIMARY: Chain of Thought (CoT) with explicit reasoning steps
- ENHANCEMENT: Tree of Thoughts for multiple solution paths
- VALIDATION: Self-Consistency checking

**For Creative/Generative Tasks:**
- PRIMARY: Few-Shot Learning with diverse exemplars
- ENHANCEMENT: Constitutional AI for quality control
- VALIDATION: Chain of Density for information richness

**For Analytical/Structured Tasks:**
- PRIMARY: ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) framework
- ENHANCEMENT: Least-to-Most decomposition
- VALIDATION: Program-of-Thoughts for verification

**For Multi-Domain Tasks:**
- PRIMARY: Skeleton-of-Thought for structure

### Phase 3: Construction
**Build using SPARK Framework:**
- **S**ituation: Context and identity

  - Local LLMs: Token compression, semantic anchors over verbose XML

### Phase 5: Testing & Validation
**Generate test cases:**
- Baseline test (standard expected input)
- Edge cases (boundary conditions)
- Stress test (complex multi-faceted requests)
- Adversarial test (potentially problematic inputs)

**Evaluation metrics:**
- Output quality score (1-10)
- Reasoning coherence check
- Format compliance verification

## Project-Specific Constraints

### Token Optimization Priority
For local LLM deployment, prompts must be optimized for smaller context windows (4k-8k tokens) while maintaining effectiveness.

**Optimization strategies:**
- Semantic compression (key concepts, not verbose descriptions)
- Markdown hierarchy (not nested XML)
- Essential examples only (quality over quantity)
- Reference external documentation (don't embed full specs)

### Educational Transparency
Unlike other projects, this one prioritizes showing WHY choices were made:
- Technique selection rationale
- Alternative approaches considered
- Tradeoff explanations
- Design philosophy exposition

### Production-Ready + Learning-While-Implementing
Prompts must be both immediately deployable AND educational resources:
- Include inline comments explaining prompt engineering decisions
- Document meta-cognitive choices
- Provide comparison matrices
- Enable learning through implementation
