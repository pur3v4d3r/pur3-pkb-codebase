## Vault Organization Architecture

### 577-Tag Taxonomy System
The vault employs a comprehensive 577-tag hierarchical taxonomy organized across four levels:

**L1 (Broad Domains)** - ~15 top-level categories:
- `#cognitive-science`, `#philosophy`, `#psychology`, `#neuroscience`
- `#learning-theory`, `#pkm`, `#obsidian`, `#prompt-engineering`
- `#software-development`, `#productivity`, `#ethics`, `#cosmology`
- `#paleontology`, `#stoicism`, `#self-development`

**L2 (Methodologies/Frameworks)** - ~80 methodology-specific tags:
- `#zettelkassel`, `#react-framework`, `#constitutional-ai`
- `#self-determination-theory`, `#cognitive-load-theory`
- `#spaced-repetition`, `#progressive-summarization`
- `#moc-structure`, `#evergreen-notes`, `#atomic-concepts`

**L3 (Content Types)** - ~40 structural classification tags:
- `#atomic-note`, `#reference-note`, `#moc`, `#synthesis-note`
- `#index-note`, `#dashboard`, `#template`, `#example-note`
- `#process-note`, `#comparison-note`, `#project-hub`

**L4 (Granular Specifics)** - ~440+ domain-specific technical tags:
- Plugin-specific: `#dataview-query`, `#templater-script`, `#meta-bind-button`
- Concept-specific: `#working-memory`, `#intrinsic-motivation`, `#epistemic-status`
- Framework-specific: `#paul-elder-framework`, `#bloom-taxonomy`, `#sweller-clt`

**Tag Application Strategy:**
- Position 1: Primary domain (mandatory)
- Position 2: Methodology/framework (mandatory)
- Position 3: Content type (mandatory)
- Position 4+: Technical specifics (optional, context-dependent)

**Contextual Filtering:**
Progressive revelation system reduces cognitive load by showing relevant tag subsets (25-40 tags) based on domain context rather than overwhelming with full 577-tag display.

## 6-Pillar Hub Architecture

The knowledge base is organized around six major domain hubs:

**1. Cognitive Science Hub**
- Completed MOC with 25+ permanent notes
- Covers: attention, memory, perception, language, social cognition
- Identified gaps: Perception & Sensory Processing, Language & Communication

**2. Philosophy Hub**
- Completed MOC with focus on Stoic philosophy
- Covers: ethics, epistemology, logic, metaphysics
- Daily Stoic practice integration

**3. Learning & Memory Hub**
- Recently completed MOC
- Covers: encoding, storage, retrieval, forgetting, enhancement techniques
- Integration with spaced repetition systems

**4. Personal Knowledge Management Hub**
- Active development
- Covers: Zettelkasten, PARA, progressive summarization, MOC architecture
- Meta-level PKM methodology documentation

**5. Prompt Engineering Hub**
- Active development

- Intentionally deferred until infrastructure achieves stability
- Foundation-first principle in action

---

## Maturity Tracking System

All permanent notes are classified by developmental maturity:

**🌱 Seedling** (Initial capture, rough notes)
- Basic structure established
- Core concept identified
- Requires significant development
- May contain gaps or placeholders

**🌿 Budding** (Developing content)
- Substantial content present
- Key connections identified
- Some examples and elaboration
- Needs refinement and expansion

**🌳 Evergreen** (Mature, reliable reference)
- Comprehensive coverage
- Well-connected to knowledge graph
- Examples, evidence, and elaboration complete
- Regularly reviewed and maintained

**🍂 Wilting** (Needs review/update)
- Content may be outdated
- Connections may have broken
- Requires revision or archival
- Flagged for maintenance attention

**Maturity Progression:**
Notes evolve through stages as they receive attention, connections, and refinement. Maturity status tracked in YAML frontmatter and visualized in MOC dashboards.

---

## Confidence/Certainty Scoring

Epistemic status tracking for knowledge claims:

**Speculative** - Hypothesis, untested idea, early exploration  
**Probable** - Some evidence, preliminary validation, reasonable confidence  
**Confident** - Strong evidence, multiple sources, high reliability  
**Verified** - Empirically validated, authoritative consensus, established fact

Confidence scores enable:
- Appropriate epistemic humility in note content
- Flagging areas requiring further research
- Distinguishing established knowledge from working hypotheses
- Tracking verification status over time

---

## MOC (Map of Content) Layout Standard

All MOCs follow standardized structure (established in `practical-philosophy-moc`):

### Dashboard Metrics Section

## Self-Documenting Knowledge Systems

### Automated Relationship Discovery
DataviewJS queries that:
- Find notes sharing tag combinations
- Identify connection patterns
- Suggest missing links
- Visualize knowledge clusters

### Recursive Discovery Patterns
Queries that discover other queries:
- Meta-query systems
- Self-indexing mechanisms
- Zero-maintenance automation
- Emergent network effects

### Plugin Synergy for Emergent Capabilities
Not sequential operations, but multiplicative effects:
- Dataview + Templater → Dynamic content generation from queries
- Meta Bind + Tasks → Interactive task management dashboards
- Charts + Dataview → Automated knowledge analytics
- QuickAdd + Templater → Context-aware capture workflows
