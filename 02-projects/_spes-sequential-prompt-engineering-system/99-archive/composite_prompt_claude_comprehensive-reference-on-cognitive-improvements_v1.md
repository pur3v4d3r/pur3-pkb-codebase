<goal>
A comprehensive and foundational reference document that contains all the information needed to fully deep dive into and study/research the topic of Self Learning/Cognitive Developmental Improvement/How to think. That can provide me the tools I need to live a successful life of: **A lifelong self-motivated knowledge management specialist/expert/master**.
