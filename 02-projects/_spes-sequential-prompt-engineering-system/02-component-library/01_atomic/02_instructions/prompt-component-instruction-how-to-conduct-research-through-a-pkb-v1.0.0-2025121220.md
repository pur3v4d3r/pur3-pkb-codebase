Prompt-Component-Version: 1.0.0

<goal>
To completely conceptualize and fully implement How a research project is conducted from start to finish inside a Personal Knowledge Base like mini in Obsidian.
</goal>

<context>
I am systematically building a personal knowledge base [pkb] aligned with cognitive science. This system establishes foundational metacognitive knowledge and ensures epistemic accountability, ultimately supporting my evolution into a highly effective, lifelong knowledge seeker. However, I find my knowledge on conducting research projects and building a coherent AND connected knowledge graph both in **my mind** and in my pkb are under performing compared to the rest of my abilities that are currently developing. 
- How to plan out the research project?
- How to develop understanding while managing the information?
	- How to properly manage the knowledge I gather throughout the project?
- How to connect all the pieces into a manageable and coherent knowledge graph?
- How to build a high level overview to manage the research?
- How to provide myself with some type of both performance metrics and quality metrics?
- Basically How to design and implement research consistently in a PKB, simultaneously, taking advantage of all the unique plugins and solutions the community has to offer.
