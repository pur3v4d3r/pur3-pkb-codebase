# 🔄The Comparative Framework Scaffold

**[RATIONALE]:** Grounded in comparative cognition and schema theory, this model structures learning by systematically analyzing 2-3 related concepts/theories/systems side-by-side. It forces explicit identification of similarities, differences, strengths, and contextual applications. While your Deep Exposition excels at vertical depth, this model develops horizontal breadth and discriminatory thinking—essential for synthesizing across domains in your PKB.

**Note:**
- **Learning model based on:** Comparative cognition, schema theory, and contrastive learning principles
- **Specific pedagogical purpose:** This model builds sophisticated discriminatory thinking by forcing systematic comparison across multiple related concepts. By explicitly mapping similarities, differences, strengths, and contextual applications, it develops the precise categorical thinking essential for expert-level understanding. This complements your Deep Exposition model by building horizontal connections rather than vertical depth.
- **Best use cases:**
  1. Understanding related but distinct concepts (e.g., different types of memory systems, various forms of government, competing statistical methods)
  2. Developing precise terminology and avoiding conceptual conflation in your PKB
  3. Building decision frameworks for selecting appropriate theories/methods for specific contexts

# Comparative Analysis: {{CONCEPT A}} vs. {{CONCEPT B}} vs. {{CONCEPT C}}

**Note:** This scaffold develops discriminatory precision through systematic comparison. Use when understanding the *boundaries* between concepts is as important as understanding the concepts themselves.

---

> [!pre-read-questions]
> - {{What do these concepts have in common?}}
> - {{What are the most important differences between them?}}
> - {{Under what circumstances would I choose one over the others?}}
> - {{What confusions might arise from conflating these concepts?}}

---

> [!abstract]
> {{Provide a 2-3 paragraph overview that: (1) introduces the concepts being compared, (2) explains why comparison is valuable (what confusion does it resolve or what precision does it enable?), (3) previews the major dimensions of similarity and difference, and (4) hints at the decision framework for appropriate application.}}
