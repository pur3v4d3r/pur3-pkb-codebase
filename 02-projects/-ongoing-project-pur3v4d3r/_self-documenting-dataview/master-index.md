### Common Queries Reference

#### Self-Discovery Query (Core Pattern)
```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID
  file.link as "📄 Note",
  Field1,
  Field2,
  Field3
FROM "Knowledge Domains/[Domain]/01-Applications"
FLATTEN file.outlinks as links
WHERE meta(links).path = this.file.path
GROUP BY file.link
```

**Customization Points**:
- `Field1, Field2, Field3`: Replace with your metadata field names
- `"Knowledge Domains/[Domain]/01-Applications"`: Your applications folder path

---

#### Progress Tracking (DataviewJS)
```javascript
status:: `$= dv.current().status`
```

Place this immediately after frontmatter. Requires:
- DataviewJS enabled
- Status Tasks section in note
- Progress tracking code in domain config

---

#### Orphan Detection
```dataview
LIST
FROM "Knowledge Domains/[Domain]/00-Concepts"
WHERE length(file.inlinks) = 0 AND Type != null
```

Shows concepts with no application notes.

---

#### Concept Coverage
```dataview
TABLE
  Type as "Concept Type",
  length(file.inlinks) as "Usage Count",
  status as "Documentation Status"
FROM "Knowledge Domains/[Domain]/00-Concepts"
WHERE Type != null
SORT length(file.inlinks) DESC
```

Shows which concepts are most/least referenced.

## 💡 Tips for Success

### For First-Time Implementers

> [!helpful-tip] Start Small, Scale Gradually
> - Don't try to document your entire knowledge base on Day 1
> - Start with 3-5 concepts you reference frequently
> - Create 5-10 application notes to validate system
> - **The system becomes valuable through consistent use, not exhaustive initial setup**

> [!helpful-tip] Trust the Self-Discovery Process
> - It feels magical when applications automatically appear in concept queries
> - Resist urge to manually maintain cross-references
> - Let the queries do the work - that's the point!

> [!helpful-tip] Customize, Don't Perfect
> - Templates are starting points, not rigid requirements
> - Adapt metadata schema as you learn what you need
> - Taxonomy can evolve - don't overthink initial design

---

### For Scaling to Multiple Domains

> [!helpful-tip] Establish Patterns First
> - Get your first domain to 50+ notes before adding second domain
> - Learn what works for you before replicating
> - Second domain will be 2-3x faster than first

> [!helpful-tip] Identify Shared Concepts Early
> - Some concepts appear in multiple domains (e.g., "emergence", "feedback loops")
> - Document these as cross-domain concepts
> - Create synthesis notes connecting domains

> [!helpful-tip] Build Central Infrastructure
> - Domain Registry note tracks all domains
> - Cross-domain analytics dashboard
> - Shared concept index

---

### For Long-Term Maintenance

> [!helpful-tip] Weekly Health Checks (15 min)
> - Run orphan detection for each domain
> - Check incomplete documentation (Status Tasks)
> - Review recent applications for quality

> [!helpful-tip] Monthly Deep Dives (30 min)
> - Analyze domain growth trends
> - Identify high-value concepts (many inlinks)
> - Create synthesis notes connecting multiple concepts
> - Refine taxonomy if needed

> [!helpful-tip] Quarterly System Reviews (60 min)
> - Evaluate metadata schema effectiveness
> - Optimize query performance
> - Update templates based on learnings
