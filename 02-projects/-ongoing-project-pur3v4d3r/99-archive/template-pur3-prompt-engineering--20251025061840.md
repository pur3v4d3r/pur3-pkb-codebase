## ✅ 2.0 Master Task List (The Source of Truth)

**Phase 1.0:** *Strategic Preparation (Discovery & Intent)*
  - [ ] `P1/S1.0` Intent & Context: Define the specific knowledge artifact being created (e.g., Atomic Note on X). #workflow
  - [ ] `P1/S1.0` Contextualization: Identify and select existing PKB notes to serve as contextual grounding data for the prompt (RAG). #workflow
  - [ ] `P1/S1.1` Role Structuring: Assign the prompt a detailed Role (e.g., specialized scientist) and Tone. #workflow
  - [ ] `P1/S1.1` Constraint Setting: Define explicit Constraints (e.g., word count, reading level, citation requirements). #workflow
  - [ ] `P1/S1.1` Output Schema: Demand the output in a precise, structured data format (e.g., JSON/YAML/specific Markdown). #workflow

**Phase 2.0:** *Generative Iteration (Capture & Refinement)***
  - [ ] `P2/S2.0` CoT Prompting: Embed mandatory Chain-of-Thought (CoT) instructions (e.g., "First, Define... Second, Analyze..."). #workflow
  - [ ] `P2/S2.0` Temperature Check: Select and register the appropriate Temperature setting in the YAML header (e.g., 0.1 for fact). #workflow
  - [ ] `P2/S2.1` Initial Assessment: Check the first generation for Accuracy, Relevance, Format, and Completeness. #workflow
  - [ ] `P2/S2.1` Refinement Cycle: If deficient, Refine the Prompt (not the output text) and re-test. #workflow
  - [ ] `P2/S2.1` Complexity Check: If refinement is excessive, implement Sequential Prompts (break into smaller queries). #workflow

**Phase 3.0:** *Curatorial Validation (Organize & Critique)*
  - [ ] `P3/S3.0` Factual Verification: Manually validate all key factual assertions against trusted external sources. #workflow
  - [ ] `P3/S3.0` Source Traceability: Trace and verify the legitimacy and currency of any LLM-cited sources. #workflow
  - [ ] `P3/S3.1` Adversarial Critique: Generate a second prompt to challenge the output's integrity (e.g., check for bias or counter-arguments). #workflow
  - [ ] `P3/S3.2` Quality Scoring: Assign a definitive success_rating (0-5) in the YAML front matter. #workflow
  - [ ] `P3/S3.2` Meta-Data Registration: Ensure all tracking parameters (model, etc.) are filled in the YAML. #workflow

**Phase 4.0:** *Assimilation & Synthesis (Use & Optimize)*
  - [ ] `P4/S4.0` Atomic Decomposition: Break the validated output into concise, granular Atomic Notes (Zettels). #workflow
  - [ ] `P4/S4.0` Linking: Link each new note (via bidirectional links) to at least three existing relevant concepts. #workflow
  - [ ] `P4/S4.1` Structured Assimilation: Integrate the new notes into an existing Map of Content (MOC), or create a new MOC. #workflow
  - [ ] `P4/S4.2` Deep Synthesis: Perform deep synthesis (e.g., Feynman Technique) on the new knowledge. #workflow
  - [ ] `P4/S4.2` Actionable Application: Extract at least one verb-first, actionable task from the content. #workflow
  - [ ] `P4/S4.2` Review Scheduling: Set the review_date property in the YAML front matter for spaced repetition. #workflow
