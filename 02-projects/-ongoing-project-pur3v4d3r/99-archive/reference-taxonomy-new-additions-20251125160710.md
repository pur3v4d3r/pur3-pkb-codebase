> [!abstract]
> **Executive Overview**
> This reference note provides a comprehensive, hierarchical [[Tag Taxonomy]] for organizing knowledge in [[Cognitive Science]] and [[03-notes/01_permanent-notes/02_personal-knowledge-base/Personal Knowledge Management]] domains within an [[obsidian]] vault. The taxonomy follows multi-level abstraction principles, enabling both broad categorization and granular specificity while maintaining semantic clarity and discoverability.

> [!how-to-use-this]
> **Navigation Guide**
> This taxonomy is organized into two primary domain sections, each containing multiple hierarchical levels from high-level domains down to specific topics. Use the tag levels progressively: start with top-level domain tags, then add mid-level specialization tags, and finally granular topic tags as needed. The cross-domain integration section shows how tags can bridge both domains for interdisciplinary notes.

## 📐 Tag Usage Guidelines & Best Practices

> [!methodology-and-sources]
> **Tag Application Principles**
> Effective tagging requires strategic selection. More tags ≠ better organization. Each tag should serve a discoverable purpose.

### Optimal Tag Density

> [!helpful-tip]
> **Tag Count Recommendations**
> - **Simple notes**: 3-5 tags (domain + 1-2 specific)
> - **Reference notes**: 5-8 tags (domain + subdiscipline + topics)
> - **Integration notes**: 6-10 tags (multiple domains + cross-cutting)
> - **Avoid**: More than 10 tags (indicates lack of focus or over-classification)

### Hierarchical Tagging Strategy

> [!core-principle]
> **Progressive Specificity**
> Always include hierarchical progression: start broad, get specific only when needed.

**Pattern: General → Specific**
```markdown
# Example 1: Memory Research Note
#cognitive-science          [L1: Domain]
#cognitive-psychology       [L2: Subdiscipline]
#memory-systems             [L3: Core system]
#working-memory             [L3: Specific system]
#phonological-loop          [L4: Mechanism]
#empirical-research         [Cross-cutting: Method]
```

```markdown
# Example 2: PKM Implementation Note
#pkm                        [L1: Domain]
#capture-system             [L2: Component]
#quickadd                   [L3: Tool]
#quickadd-macros            [L4: Technique]
#automation                 [Cross-cutting: Feature]
#in-progress                [Cross-cutting: Status]
```

### Tag Combination Patterns

> [!example]
> **Common Tag Combinations**

**Cognitive Science Theory Note:**
```
#cognitive-science
#cognitive-load-theory
#working-memory-capacity
#instructional-design
#reference-note
```

**Applied PKM Technique:**
```
#pkm
#obsidian
#dataview
#dataview-queries
#automation
#in-progress
```

**Integration Note (Cog Sci + PKM):**
```
#cognitive-pkm
#spaced-review-system
#memory-systems-design
#obsidian
#tasks-plugin
#evidence-based-pkm
#reference-note
```

### Search & Query Optimization

> [!methodology-and-sources]
> **Dataview Query Examples**
> Leverage hierarchical tags in Dataview queries for powerful filtering.

**Find all cognitive science notes on memory:**
```dataview
LIST
FROM #cognitive-science 
WHERE contains(tags, "memory")
SORT file.mtime DESC
```

**Find PKM implementation notes in progress:**
```dataview
TABLE status, tags
FROM #pkm 
WHERE contains(tags, "in-progress")
SORT file.ctime DESC
```

**Find integration notes between cognition and PKM:**
```dataview
LIST
WHERE contains(tags, "cognitive-pkm") 
   OR (contains(tags, "cognitive-science") 
       AND contains(tags, "pkm"))
```

### Tag Maintenance Practices

> [!warning]
> **Common Tag Problems**
> - **Tag proliferation**: Creating too many similar tags (e.g., #memory, #memory-systems, #memories)
> - **Inconsistent casing**: #CognitiveScience vs. #cognitive-science
> - **Typos**: #cogntive-science
> - **Orphan tags**: Tags used once and never again
> - **Semantic overlap**: Multiple tags meaning same thing

**Maintenance Checklist:**
- [ ] Review tag usage quarterly with Dataview query
- [ ] Consolidate synonymous tags
- [ ] Retire unused tags (< 3 notes)
- [ ] Standardize tag casing and formatting
- [ ] Document tag taxonomy updates in this note
- [ ] Use Tag Wrangler plugin for batch edits

### Tag vs. Folder Decision Framework

> [!helpful-tip]
> **When to Use Tags vs. Folders**

**Use Folders When:**
- Clear hierarchical containment (e.g., all daily notes)
- Mutually exclusive categories (note can only be in one place)
- File system organization matters (exports, backups)

**Use Tags When:**
- Multiple categorizations needed (note fits many contexts)
- Cross-cutting concerns (methodology, status, content type)
- Discovery and querying are priorities
- Flexibility to reclassify is important

**Use Both When:**
- Folder = structural location (where it lives)
- Tags = semantic classification (what it means)

Example:
```
Location: 03_permanent-notes/cognitive-science/
Tags: #cognitive-science #working-memory #cognitive-load-theory #reference-note
```

## 🧠 Domain 1: Cognitive Science (`#cog-sci`)

Cognitive science is interdisciplinary. To avoid a cluttered graph, we must organize tags by **Functional Process** (how the mind works) and **Disciplinary Lens** (who is studying it).

### The Hierarchy

#### 1\. The Architecture of Mind (Process-Based)

These tags categorize notes based on *what function* the brain/mind is performing.

  * **`#cog-sci/perception`**: For sensory processing, signal detection theory, and phenomenology.
      * *Use for:* [[Visual Cortex]], [[Auditory Processing]], [[Proprioception]].
  * **`#cog-sci/memory`**: The storage and retrieval mechanisms.
      * *Use for:* [[Long-Term Potentiation]], [[Working Memory]], [[03-notes/01_permanent-notes/01_cognitive-development/Spaced Repetition]].

## ⚙️ Domain 2: PKB & PKM (`#pkm`)

For Personal Knowledge Management, we distinguish between the **Methodology** (the theory) and the **Workflow** (the action).

### The Hierarchy

#### 1\. The Workflow Lifecycle (Action-Based)

These tags track the state of information as it moves through your system.

  * **`#pkm/capture`**: Ingesting information (Inbox phase).
      * *Use for:* Quick capture ideas, raw highlights.
  * **`#pkm/process`**: Refining and atomizing information.
      * *Use for:* Turning highlights into [[Atomic Notes]], progressive summarization.
  * **`#pkm/connect`**: Linking and gardening.
      * *Use for:* Building MOCs, reviewing orphans.
  * **`#pkm/synthesis`**: Creating new outputs.
      * *Use for:* Writing essays, project deliverables, content creation.
  * **`#pkm/maintenance`**: System hygiene.
      * *Use for:* Reviewing plugins, reorganizing folders, deprecating tags.

#### 2\. Methodologies & Frameworks (Theory-Based)

  * **`#pkm/zettelkasten`**: Notes related to the "Slip-box" method.
      * *Sub-tags:* `#pkm/zettelkasten/structure`, `#pkm/zettelkasten/principles`.

  * **`#pkm/lyt`**: Nick Milo’s Linking Your Thinking (Maps of Content).
  * **`#pkm/metacognition`**: Thinking about thinking (The overlap with CogSci).

#### 3\. Note Archetypes (Type-Based)

> [!helpful-tip]
> Some users prefer a root tag `#type/` for this, but keeping it under `#pkm/` keeps the domain tight. Choose what fits your brain.

  * **`#pkm/type/atomic`**: Single concept, declarative knowledge.
  * **`#pkm/type/source`**: Reference material (books, videos, papers).
  * **`#pkm/type/moc`**: Map of Content (Hubs).
  * **`#pkm/type/daily`**: Journaling and logging.
  * **`#pkm/type/definition`**: Pure terminology.

## 🔗 The "Bridge" Tags (Intersection)

The most powerful area of your vault is where CogSci explains *why* PKM works. These tags bridge the two domains.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[#cognitive-science] --> C{Intersection}
    B[#pkm] --> C
    C --> D[#cognition/load-theory]
    C --> E[#cognition/extended-mind]
    C --> F[#learning/science]
```

### Critical Intersection Concepts

  * **`#cognitive-load`**: Managing the volume of information (PKM) based on brain limits (CogSci).
  * **`#extended-mind`**: The philosophy that your PKB is an actual extension of your biological brain (Clark & Chalmers).
  * **`#active-recall`**: A learning mechanism applied through note retrieval strategies.

## 🛠️ Implementation Strategy

> [!methodology-and-sources] How to Apply This Taxonomy
>
> 1.  **Don't Retag Everything:** Start using these tags for *new* notes only.
> 2.  **Use Tag Wrangler:** If you have the **Tag Wrangler** plugin installed in Obsidian, you can rename your existing messy tags to these nested versions in batch.
> 3.  **Graph Groups:** Go to your Graph View settings -\> Groups. Assign colors to your L1 tags:
>       * `tag:#cog-sci` = 🔵 Blue (Theory/Science)
>       * `tag:#pkm` = 🟢 Green (Action/System)
> 4.  **Folder Independence:** Remember, these tags allow you to abandon rigid folder structures. A note can be located anywhere but found instantly via `#cog-sci/memory`.

Here is a comprehensive, hierarchically structured tag taxonomy designed for **Cognitive Science** and **Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)**.

I have designed this using **Nested Tags** (e.g., `#parent/child`). This is the most robust way to handle taxonomies in Obsidian, as it allows you to filter by the broad category (Parent) or the specific niche (Child) using the tag pane or [[dataview]] queries.

## 🛠️ Implementation Guide

### How to use this in Frontmatter

When creating a new note, select **one** primary hierarchy and **one** descriptive tag.

**Example 1: A note about "The Forgetting Curve"**

```yaml
---
tags: #cognition/memory #learning-science #retention
aliases: [Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve, Memory Decay]
---
```

**Example 2: A Map of Content for your "Writing" folder**

```yaml
---
tags: #pkm/structure/moc #pkm/output #writing
aliases: [Writing Hub, Content Dashboard]
---
```

### 🔍 Self-Critique & Optimization

> [\!tip]
> **Avoid "Collector's Fallacy"**
> Do not create tags just to have them. Only add a tag to your system if you plan to **query** it later (e.g., "Show me all notes about `#neuroscience/neuroplasticity`"). If you will never search for it, the tag is noise.
