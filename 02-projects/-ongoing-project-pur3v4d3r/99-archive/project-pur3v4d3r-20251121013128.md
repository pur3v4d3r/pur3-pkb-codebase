	- This will be the start of a collection of Templates that use various plugins synergistically.
		- Design prompts from generating these Templates as I need them.
			- The prompt should be rather simple with the output of 1 extremely high quality template, that uses my Active Plugin Stack at the time, synergistically.
- Finish the Templater Cheat sheet for working on Templates.

	- The best way seems to just get a bunch of queries and start using them in a sandbox note.
		- You will need to determine what and how to deploy a sandbox note.
	- After sucessfully learning DQL Query Language, then start to learn and understand Javascript Queries.
- Have the LLMs generate many poissible different types of queries and diplays using Javascipt.
```

```

```
### Meta Bind and Commander
- Create a note on all your most used Hotkey and Command Pallette Action and turn those into Commander buttons.
- Learn the syntax for creating various useful Meta bind applications.
```




```
### Various UN-catorgerized
- Create the Hub Note for Project: Pur3v4d3r
	- Using the various reference materials I have generated.

- Find and implement more useful metrics / logs and JavaScript displays for dashboards/index notes throughout the PKB.
	- Create the remaining index notes.

- Set-up Obsidian Web-clipper
	- Learn the Syntax and variables for writing my own templates.
	- Set-up and get working multiple Interpreter Templates.
		- That use both Gemini API, and my Local LLMS.

- Finish moving Database 1 to Database 2
- Implement the lessons learned through enacting these changes, into the project for the Prompt Component Library
	- Get to a working stage in the project for creating a prompt component library.
- Implement and have working the Local LLM for a Obsidian PKB AI Assistant.
- Get Text Generator/Copilot/Smart Connection up and running.
```

```
### Obsidian
- CSS Snippets
- Finish learning How Snippets function through-out obsidian.

- **Hub**
	- Easily begin travel through the projects various pathways.
- **Dashboard**
	- Self-updating dashboard with tracking and planning capabilities.
	- Need to ask Claude to figure out all of what can go here, and be beneficial to the project.
