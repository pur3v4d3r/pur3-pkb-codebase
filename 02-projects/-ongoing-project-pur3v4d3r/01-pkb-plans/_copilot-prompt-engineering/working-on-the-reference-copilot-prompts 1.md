# Section 01  / Context of the Reference Note

### First Draft

This is a document for reference purposes. The goal of this document is to provide you with an extensive list of AI prompts to be in conjunction with the plugin for Obsidian "Copilot." The prompts that are presented here are from various sources, I will provide links to both the corresponding notes and the website where the AI chatbot resides. These prompts have been meticulously engineered with the sole purpose of being used inside of a [[PKB]] atmosphere, and with an AI who has access to certain types of information here inside the [[PKB]]. Due to the large volume of prompts they will be organized by category. There will be a section devoted to functionally navigating to each of the prompts or main category that the prompt is located. (In-case you just want to look around at some of the various prompts in the collection.)[^1]

### Dr. Evelyn Reed Re-Work

This guide is a comprehensive library of AI prompts, meticulously crafted for the Obsidian "Copilot" plugin. Curated from various sources, these prompts include links to the original notes and AI tools where applicable.

Each prompt is designed for a Personal Knowledge Base ([[PKB]]) environment, assuming the AI has access to your internal notes. For easy navigation, the collection is organized by category, with a dedicated section to help you find specific prompts or simply browse at your leisure.[^2]


### Editorial Review Team Re-Work
# Master Reference: AI Prompts for Obsidian Copilot

This document contains a curated collection of AI prompts designed specifically for the "Copilot" plugin within a Personal Knowledge Base ([[PKB]]) environment.

Each prompt has been engineered to leverage an AI with access to your notes, helping you synthesize information, generate ideas, and manage your knowledge more effectively.

### How This Collection is Organized

- **Categorized for Workflow:** To help you find the right tool for the job, all prompts are organized by functional category (e.g., Synthesis, Ideation, Review).
    
- **Sourced & Linked:** Prompts are compiled from various expert sources. Where applicable, links are provided to the original notes and external resources for additional context.
    
- **Easy Navigation:** A full table of contents follows this introduction, allowing you to jump directly to any category or specific prompt.[^3]

### My Architectural Strategy[[Prompt_AI-Prompts-for-Copilot-with-Synergistical-Properties_Gemini-2.5-Pro_2025-09-28_Aris]]

1. **Categorization by Workflow:** I will organize the prompts into logical categories that mirror the stages of a robust Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) workflow: **Capture & Ingestion**, **Processing & Structuring**, **Synthesis & Creation**, **Linking & Connecting**, **Review & Resurfacing**, and a special section for **Advanced Workflow Automation**. This ensures each prompt has a clear, practical purpose.
2. **Synergistic Design:** I will focus heavily on prompts that create a "golden triangle" of synergy between **Copilot (AI)**, **Dataview (Querying)**, and **Tasks (Action)**. This is where the true power lies—turning static notes into a dynamic, responsive system.
3. **Standardized Prompt Blueprint:** As you requested, every prompt will be presented in a uniform block for easy scanning and implementation. This block will contain:
    * **🎯 Goal:** The specific outcome this prompt is designed to achieve.
    * **⚡ Trigger:** The situation or workflow stage where this prompt is most useful.
    * **⚙️ The Prompt:** The fully-engineered prompt, ready to be copied. I will use placeholders like `{}` or `{{selected_text}}` which are compatible with plugins like Copilot to denote where your own text or note content should be inserted.
4. **Embedded Engineering Principles:** Within the prompts themselves, I will embed best practices. This includes assigning a clear **role** to the AI, providing structured **context**, giving step-by-step **instructions** (Chain-of-Thought), and defining the desired **output format** with precision. This is not just for the AI; it is for your own learning, demonstrating the *why* behind the *what*.

Here is the blueprint for your new cognitive engine.

#  Obsidian Copilot: The Ultimate Prompt Library

This document serves as a central library for advanced AI prompts designed to supercharge your Obsidian vault. Its purpose is to provide a practical, actionable, and synergistic set of tools that integrate deeply with your existing plugins to enhance every stage of your knowledge workflow.

### How to Use This Library

1. **Identify Your Need:** Browse the Table of Contents to find the workflow stage you want to enhance (e.g., "Processing a new article").
2. **Copy the Prompt:** Navigate to the relevant prompt and copy the text from "The Prompt" block.
3. **Utilize in Copilot:** In Obsidian, use the Copilot plugin to run the prompt. Many prompts are designed to work on selected text (`{}`), the active note (`{activeNote}`), or by referencing other notes (`{[[Note Title]]}`).
4. **Adapt and Iterate:** Treat these prompts as high-quality templates. The most powerful prompt engineering is an iterative process. Feel free to modify them to better suit your specific needs.

### Persona: The Knowledge Cartographer

[ROLE]

Assume the persona of a Knowledge Cartographer. You are a specialist in information architecture and navigation within the Obsidian ecosystem. Your sole focus is on creating clear, functional, and elegant Tables of Contents (TOCs) that transform disparate notes into a cohesive, navigable whole.

**[EXPERTISE]**

- **Structural Mastery:** You possess an expert understanding of Markdown, particularly nested lists, to create multi-level, hierarchical outlines.
    
- **Navigational Precision:** You are a master of Obsidian's internal linking system (`[[wikilinks]]`), including the use of aliases (`|`) and header/block references (`#`, `^`) to build TOCs that point to the exact location of information.
    
- **Dynamic Indexing:** You are proficient in leveraging the `Dataview` plugin to generate dynamic, self-updating TOCs based on tags, folder structures, or specific metadata fields.
    
- **Clarity & Design:** You have a keen eye for information hierarchy and layout, ensuring that every TOC is not just a list of links, but an intuitive map that guides the user through their knowledge.
    

[GUIDING PHILOSOPHY]

"My purpose is to bring order to the wilderness of ideas. I believe that knowledge is only as valuable as our ability to find and connect it. A well-crafted Table of Contents is not merely a list; it is the central nervous system of a Personal Knowledge Base, providing the structure upon which true insight is built. I don't just list notes—I map constellations of thought."
### Goal

I need custom and well thought out workflow for designing and building an elaborate or small TOC's, that I can reference during note construction in the [[PKB]].

Currently I am in the process of constructing a refined and polished reference document, on the various Copilot prompts I have.
I'm about to start designing and building an elaborate Table of Contents. I will include a list of the desired outcome of this and future TOC's.

### Side Note:

- I plan to use this as a permanent reference note inside the [[PKB]].
	- So It should be universally applicable.


### Goals for my TOC (for your reference)
- Links to each of the major section headers.
- Links to each of 50+ prompts.
	- Possible reverse links to the top but Idk yet.
- Hidden link reference material. (I.e.. the headers link reference number, and the super long titles.)
	- I would like to customize the title of the link if needed.
- Well thought out structure.
- Not confusing to look at.
	- Or a wall of colored text I need some way of breaking up the monotony of the wall.
```

**List of the sections that will be on the TOC:**

1. [[#📥 Section 01 - Information Capture & Triage / Information Capture & Processing 📥 |📥Information Capture & Triage📥]]
2. [[#🧠 Section 02 - Note Processing & Synthesis / Synthesis & Connection 🧠 | 🧠Note Processing & Synthesis🧠]]
