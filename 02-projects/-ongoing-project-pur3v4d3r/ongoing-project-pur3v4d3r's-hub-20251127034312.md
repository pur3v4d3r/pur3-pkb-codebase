# Core Cognitive Science Subjects/Topics
## 🏛️ Core Cognitive & Motivational Theories

> [!topic-idea]
> - **Topic or Idea**:: [[Self-Regulation Theory]]
> - **Key Figure(s)**:: *Roy Baumeister*, *Albert Bandura*
> - **Description**:: A broad framework explaining how individuals monitor, control, and direct their own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors to achieve goals. It often involves a "strength" or resource model, suggesting that self-control is a limited resource that can be depleted (a concept known as **ego depletion**). [[Albert Bandura]]'s work, in particular, emphasizes the role of **self-efficacy** (belief in one's capabilities) in this process.

> [!topic-idea]
> - **Topic or Idea**:: [[Cognitive Load Theory]]
> - **Key Figure(s)**:: *John Sweller*
> - **Description**:: An instructional theory postulating that all learning tasks impose a "load" on the brain's limited [[Working Memory]]. Effective learning must manage three types of load: **intrinsic** (the inherent difficulty), **extraneous** (the way information is presented), and **germane** (the work of integrating information into schemas). The goal is to minimize extraneous load to free up cognitive resources for germane load.

> [!topic-idea]
> - **Topic or Idea**:: [[Self-Determination Theory]]
> - **Key Figure(s)**:: *Edward L. Deci*, *Richard M. Ryan*
> - **Description**:: A macro-theory of human motivation arguing that optimal well-being and performance are fostered by satisfying three universal, innate psychological needs: **autonomy** (control over one's life), **competence** (mastery and effectiveness), and **relatedness** (connection to others). Fulfilling these needs cultivates the highest quality of motivation: [[Intrinsic Motivation]].

> [!topic-idea]
> - **Topic or Idea**:: [[Working Memory]]
> - **Key Figure(s)**:: *Alan Baddeley*, *Graham Hitch*
> - **Description**:: A cognitive system with limited capacity responsible for temporarily *holding* and *manipulating* information for complex tasks like reasoning, comprehension, and learning. It is distinct from passive short-term memory and includes components like the **phonological loop** (verbal) and **visuospatial sketchpad** (visual), managed by a **central executive**. Understanding its limits is fundamental to [[Cognitive Load Theory]].

## 🧠 Critical Thinking & Reasoning

> [!topic-idea]
> - **Topic or Idea**:: [[Critical Thinking]]
> - **Key Figure(s)**:: *John Dewey*, *Robert Ennis*
> - **Description**:: The intellectually disciplined process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and/all evaluating information gathered from observation, experience, or reflection. It is a mode of thinking in which the thinker improves the quality of their thought by imposing **intellectual standards** upon it. This involves moving beyond surface-level acceptance to question assumptions and **evaluate arguments**.

> [!topic-idea]
> - **Topic or Idea**:: [[Socrates]]
> - **Key Figure(s)**:: *Plato* (whose dialogues are the primary source)
> - **Description**:: A classical Greek philosopher credited as a founder of Western philosophy and the first moral philosopher. He is renowned for the **Socratic method** of inquiry (or *elenchus*), a form of argumentative dialogue based on asking and answering questions to stimulate [[Critical Thinking]] and draw out underlying *presuppositions*.

> [!topic-idea]
> - **Topic or Idea**:: [[Socratic Thinking]]
> - **Key Figure(s)**:: *Socrates* (originator), *Richard Paul* (modern proponent)
> - **Description**:: This refers to the application of the [[Socratic Method]] as a disciplined mode of thought. It is a form of inquiry that systematically reveals **gaps in understanding** or *aporia* (puzzlement) by continuously probing the logic and assumptions of a belief. It is the foundation of [[Critical Thinking]], used to separate what one truly knows from what one merely *thinks* they know.

> [!topic-idea]
> - **Topic or Idea**:: [[Epistemic Cognition]]
> - **Key Figure(s)**:: *William G. Perry Jr.*, *Deanna Kuhn*
> - **Description**:: This refers to "thinking about knowing" itself, specifically an individual's beliefs about the *nature* of knowledge and the *process* of knowing. It involves how individuals understand certainty, authority, and justification (e.g., moving from a dualistic "right/wrong" view to a more "relativistic" or "evaluative" one). This meta-level cognition governs how individuals **justify their beliefs** and **evaluate knowledge claims**.

> [!topic-idea]
> - **Topic or Idea**:: [[Logical Fallacies]]
> - **Key Figure(s)**:: *Aristotle* (first to systematize them)
> - **Description**:: Errors in the *structure* of reasoning that undermine the logical validity of an argument, making it unsound. Examples include **ad hominem** (attacking the person), **straw man** (misrepresenting the argument), and **false dilemma** (presenting only two choices). Identifying fallacies is a core component of analyzing [[Argument Quality (Evaluation)]].

> [!topic-idea]
> - **Topic or Idea**:: [[Cognitive Biases]]
> - **Key Figure(s)**:: *Daniel Kahneman*, *Amos Tversky*
> - **Description**:: Systematic, subconscious patterns of deviation from rationality in judgment, often arising from mental shortcuts (**heuristics**) used to process information quickly. Unlike logical fallacies (flaws in argument structure), biases are flaws in the *process* of thinking itself, such as **confirmation bias** (favoring information that confirms one's beliefs) or the **availability heuristic** (overestimating the importance of easily recalled information).

> [!topic-idea]
> - **Topic or Idea**:: [[Argument Quality (Evaluation)]]
> - **Key Figure(s)**:: *Stephen Toulmin*
> - **Description**:: The process of evaluating an argument's strength by analyzing its core components: the **claim** (conclusion), the **grounds** (evidence), and the **warrant** (the logical bridge connecting grounds to claim). A high-quality argument is not only *logically valid* (structurally sound) but also *sound* (its premises are true and relevant). The **Toulmin Model** provides a robust framework for this analysis.

## ⚙️ Learning Strategies & Metacognition

> [!topic-idea]
> - **Topic or Idea**:: [[Metacognition]]
> - **Key Figure(s)**:: *John H. Flavell*
> - **Description**:: Often defined as "thinking about one's own thinking," this is a higher-order process that involves awareness and control of one's thought processes. It has two main components: **metacognitive knowledge** (what one knows about their own cognition) and **metacognitive regulation** (how one manages their learning, such as planning, monitoring, and evaluating). It is the parent concept for [[Self-Regulated Learning]] and [[Self-Explanation]].

> [!topic-idea]
> - **Topic or Idea**:: [[Metacognitive Planning]]
> - **Key Figure(s)**:: *Barry Zimmerman*, *John H. Flavell*
> - **Description**:: This is the **forethought phase** of [[Metacognition]], occurring *before* a task begins. It involves setting specific learning goals, activating relevant prior knowledge, analyzing the task's demands, and selecting the appropriate [[Cognitive Strategies]] and [[Metacognitive Strategies]] for the job. This is the "game plan" stage of [[Self-Regulated Learning]].

> [!topic-idea]
> - **Topic or Idea**:: [[Metacognitive Monitoring]]
> - **Key Figure(s)**:: *John Dunlosky*, *Janet Metcalfe*
> - **Description**:: I am adding this topic as it is the critical link between planning and reflection. This is the *in-the-moment* awareness and tracking of one's own learning and comprehension *during* a task. It involves processes like "judgments of learning" (JOLs)—assessing how well you know something—which allows you to make real-time adjustments, such as re-reading a confusing paragraph or switching strategies.

> [!topic-idea]
> - **Topic or Idea**:: [[Metacognitive Reflection]]
> - **Key Figure(s)**:: *Barry Zimmerman*, *Donald Schön*
> - **Description**:: This is the **self-reflection phase** that occurs *after* a learning attempt, forming the crucial feedback loop in [[Self-Regulated Learning]]. It involves **self-evaluation** (judging one's performance against the goal) and **self-reaction** (attributing outcomes to specific causes, like effort or strategy choice). This reflection is what informs and improves future [[Metacognitive Planning]].

> [!topic-idea]
> - **Topic or Idea**:: [[Metacognitive Strategies]]
> - **Key Figure(s)**:: *John H. Flavell*, *Michael Pressley*
> - **Description**:: These are the specific, goal-directed procedures used to *regulate* cognition, as distinct from [[Cognitive Strategies]] which are used to *perform* the task. Metacognitive strategies include the active processes of **planning** (e.g., "What's my goal here?"), **monitoring** (e.g., "Am I understanding this?"), and **evaluating** (e.g., "How well did that strategy work?").

> [!topic-idea]
> - **Topic or Idea**:: [[Self-Regulated Learning (SRL)]]
> - **Key Figure(s)**:: *Barry Zimmerman*, *Paul Pintrich*
> - **Description**:: A cyclical, proactive process where learners set their own learning goals, select and deploy strategies, and then monitor and reflect on their progress. This framework integrates [[Metacognition]] and [[Self-Regulation Theory]] directly into the academic context. It involves three key phases: **forethought** (planning/goal setting), **performance** (monitoring/strategy use), and **self-reflection** (evaluating/adapting).

> [!topic-idea]
> - **Topic or Idea**:: [[Verbal Self-Instruction]]
> - **Key Figure(s)**:: *Donald Meichenbaum* (as part of Cognitive Behavioral Modification)
> - **Description**:: A cognitive-behavioral technique where an individual guides their own behavior by talking to themselves, often aloud initially and then sub-vocally ("private speech"). This is used to manage attention, plan sequential actions, and cope with challenging tasks. It is a core component of developing [[Self-Regulation-Theory]] and is particularly effective for multi-step problem-solving.

> [!topic-idea]
> - **Topic or Idea**:: [[Self-Explanation]]
> - **Key Figure(s)**:: *Michelene T.H. Chi*
> - **Description**:: An active learning strategy where a learner generates explanations for *themselves* while studying, such as by explaining *why* a concept is true or *how* a new piece of information relates to what they already know. This process forces the learner to **monitor their own understanding** and actively **repair comprehension failures**. It is highly effective for deep, conceptual learning.

> [!topic-idea]
> - **Topic or Idea**:: [[Cognitive Strategies]]
> - **Key Figure(s)**:: *Michael Pressley*
> - **Description**:: Specific mental procedures or "tools" that learners intentionally use to improve their learning, memory, and problem-solving. These go beyond rote memorization and include techniques like **summarization**, **imagery**, **question generation**, and **concept mapping**. They are the "how-to" of [[Metacognition]], representing the *actions* one takes based on self-monitoring.

> [!topic-idea]
> - **Topic or Idea**:: [[Mnemonic Devices]]
> - **Key Figure(s)**:: *Cicero* (Method of Loci), *Giordano Bruno*
> - **Description**:: Techniques used to improve memory encoding and retrieval, making abstract or complex information easier to recall. These strategies work by associating new information with more memorable constructs, such as **acronyms** (e.g., ROY G. BIV), **imagery** (e.g., the **Method of Loci** or "memory palace"), or **rhymes**.

> [!topic-idea]
> - **Topic or Idea**:: [[Attention Training Technique (ATT)]]
> - **Key Figure(s)**:: *Adrian Wells*
> - **Description**:: A cognitive technique, often associated with **Metacognitive Therapy**, designed to help individuals gain flexible control over their attention. It typically involves practicing the ability to **selectively attend** to specific sounds, **switch attention** between different stimuli, and **divide attention** intentionally. The goal is to break ruminative patterns and reduce the self-focused attention that can maintain anxiety.

---

## 🎯 Productivity & Cognitive Styles

> [!topic-idea]
> - **Topic or Idea**:: [[Emotion Regulation]]
> - **Key Figure(s)**:: *James J. Gross*
> - **Description**:: The process by which individuals influence *which* emotions they have, *when* they have them, and *how* they experience and express these emotions. Gross's **process model** outlines key strategies like **situation selection**, **cognitive change** (reappraisal), and **response modulation** (suppression). It is a crucial, specific domain of [[Self-Regulation Theory]].

> [!topic-idea]
> - **Topic or Idea**:: [[Goal-Setting Theory]]
> - **Key Figure(s)**:: *Edwin Locke*, *Gary Latham*
> - **Description**:: A theory of motivation proposing that specific, challenging goals lead to higher performance than vague or easy goals. The theory states that goals affect performance by **directing attention**, **mobilizing effort**, **increasing persistence**, and **motivating strategy development**. **Feedback** on progress is a critical moderator of this relationship.

> [!topic-idea]
> - **Topic or Idea**:: [[smart goals]]
> - **Key Figure(s)**:: *George T. Doran*
> - **Description**:: A practical framework and mnemonic for [[Achievable Goal Setting]] that defines goals using five criteria: **S**pecific, **M**easurable, **A**chievable, **R**elevant, and **T**ime-bound. This structure transforms vague intentions into an actionable plan and is a widely used tool in [[time management]] and [[productivity]].

> [!topic-idea]
> - **Topic or Idea**:: [[productivity]]
> - **Key Figure(s)**:: *David Allen* (Getting Things Done), *Francesco Cirillo* (Pomodoro)
> - **Description**:: A measure of output per unit of input (e.g., time or effort), but more broadly, a set of methodologies for organizing, prioritizing, and executing tasks. Systems like **Getting Things Done (GTD)** focus on externalizing all inputs into a trusted system to achieve a "mind like water." Other techniques, like the **Pomodoro Technique**, focus on time-blocking and managing attention.

> [!topic-idea]
> - **Topic or Idea**:: [[time management]]
> - **Key Figure(s)**:: *Stephen Covey* (Priority Matrix), *Peter Drucker*
> - **Description**:: The process of planning and exercising conscious control over the time spent on specific activities to increase effectiveness, efficiency, or [[productivity]]. Effective time management often involves **prioritization** (e.g., the **Eisenhower Matrix** of urgent/important), **scheduling**, and **protecting focused time**. It is fundamentally a practice of managing one's *self* and *choices*.

> [!topic-idea]
> - **Topic or Idea**:: [[Intrinsic Motivation]]
> - **Key Figure(s)**:: *Edward L. Deci*, *Harry Harlow* (early experiments)
> - **Description**:: The drive to engage in an activity for its own inherent satisfaction, pleasure, and challenge, rather than for a separable external reward. It is the core desired outcome in [[Self-Determination Theory]], which contrasts it with **extrinsic motivation** (behavior driven by rewards or punishments). Fostering intrinsic motivation is key to long-term persistence.

> [!topic-idea]
> - **Topic or Idea**:: [[Cognitive Style]]
> - **Key Figure(s)**:: *Herman Witkin* (field-dependence/independence)
> - **Description**:: An individual's preferred and habitual way of processing information, perceiving, and problem-solving. Unlike cognitive *ability* (skill level), cognitive *style* refers to the *manner* of cognition, such as being **field-dependent** (holistic, context-focused) vs. **field-independent** (analytic, context-separating). This concept is distinct from the largely debunked theory of "Learning Styles."

> [!topic-idea]
> - **Topic or Idea**:: [[Visual vs. Verbal Thinking]]
> - **Key Figure(s)**:: *Allan Paivio* (Dual-Coding Theory), *Temple Grandin* (popularizer)
> - **Description**:: A dimension of [[Cognitive Style]] describing whether an individual primarily processes information using words (**verbal-logical**) or mental images (**visual-spatial**). **Dual-Coding Theory** posits that the brain has separate channels for processing these, and information encoded in *both* forms is more easily remembered.

> [!topic-idea]
> - **Topic or Idea**:: [[Linear vs. Networked Thinking]]
> - **Key Figure(s)**:: *Tim Berners-Lee* (WWW), *Deleuze & Guattari* (Rhizome)
> - **Description**:: A distinction in how thoughts are structured. **Linear thinking** (or *sequential*) follows a step-by-step, logical progression, common in traditional essays. **Networked thinking** (or *rhizomatic*) emphasizes non-linear connections, associations, and emergent patterns, which is the foundational concept behind [[Personal Knowledge Base]] tools like Obsidian.

> [!topic-idea]
> - **Topic or Idea**:: [[Local vs. Global Processing]]
> - **Key Figure(s)**:: *David Navon* (Navon figures)
> - **Description**:: A cognitive style distinction, also known as **forest-first vs. trees-first** processing, that maps to your "big-picture vs. detail-oriented" query. **Global processing** refers to a "big-picture" orientation, focusing on the overall whole. **Local processing** is a "detail-oriented" style, focusing on the individual components.

> [! ]  # 🔗 Related Topics for PKB Expansion
> 1. **[[Epistemic Virtue Theory and Critical Thinking Frameworks]]**
>    - *Connection*: This topic bridges philosophical epistemology with practical critical thinking by examining whether framework-based critical thinking cultivates epistemic virtues (intellectual humility, courage, integrity, perseverance, fair-mindedness) as described by virtue epistemologists like Linda Zagzebski and Jason Baehr.
>    - *Depth Potential*: Merits separate exploration because it connects critical thinking skill development to broader questions about intellectual character, moral epistemology, and the relationship between knowledge and virtue—potentially revealing whether frameworks produce mere technical proficiency or genuine wisdom.
