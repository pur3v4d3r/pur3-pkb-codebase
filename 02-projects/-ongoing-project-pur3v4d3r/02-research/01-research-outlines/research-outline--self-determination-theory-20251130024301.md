### Claude Thinking:

Let me analyze this request using the ReAct Protocol:

**PHASE 1: ANALYZE**

1. **Input Classification**
   - Type: Specific theory/framework with established literature
   - Scope: Medium/comprehensive - wants "complete understanding"
   - User's current knowledge level: Unknown, but "completely understanding" suggests desire for deep mastery
   - Domain(s): Cognitive Science, Self-Development, Psychology, Motivation Theory

2. **Research Landscape Assessment**
   - Is this a well-established topic with clear literature? YES - Self-Determination Theory (SDT) is a major motivational framework developed by Deci & Ryan
   - Does this require synthesis of multiple frameworks? NO - but will benefit from comparison with other motivation theories
   - Are there foundational prerequisites? Basic understanding of psychology and motivation concepts would help
   - Complexity level: Intermediate to Advanced - well-developed theory with substantial empirical base

3. **Pedagogical Mapping**
   For SDT study, I recommend:
   - **Foundational**: For core SDT concepts and basic needs theory (good starting point)
   - **First-Principles**: For understanding the axioms underlying SDT (autonomy, competence, relatedness)
   - **Analytical**: For examining SDT's empirical evidence and applications
   - **Dialectical**: For comparing SDT with competing motivation theories (behaviorism, cognitive theories)
   - **Systems Analysis**: For understanding how SDT mini-theories interconnect
   - **Case Studies**: For real-world applications in education, work, health, etc.

4. **Structure Planning**
   - Research plan duration: Medium-term (2-3 months for complete understanding)
   - Number of major topics: 7 core topics recommended
   - Topic sequencing rationale: 
     * Start with foundational concepts and historical context
     * Build through the three basic psychological needs
     * Explore mini-theories and integration
     * Apply to domains
     * Compare with other frameworks
     * Examine empirical evidence
   - Integration points with PKB: SDT connects to motivation, psychology, learning theory, behavior change, organizational psychology, education, health psychology

**PHASE 2: RESEARCH**
Should I research? Let me check criteria:
- Topic involves post-January 2025 developments? Potentially - SDT research is ongoing
- User explicitly requests current information? No, but "complete understanding" suggests I should verify current state
- Complex synthesis needs multiple authoritative sources? Yes - SDT has evolved with multiple mini-theories

Decision: YES - I'll do a quick web search to verify current state of SDT research and ensure my recommendations are up-to-date.

Excellent! The research confirms SDT remains highly active with Ryan and Deci publishing updated work through 2024-2025, and the theory continues to expand into new domains including neuroscience, data science, compliance with laws, anti-racism, and interdisciplinary interfaces with philosophy and economics. Now I'll create a comprehensive research plan.

### Prompt for Topic 2: The Three Basic Psychological Needs

```
<topic_context>
Research Area: The Three Basic Psychological Needs - Foundational Architecture of Self-Determination Theory
Learning Objectives:
1. Define autonomy, competence, and relatedness as psychological "nutrients" essential for well-being
2. Distinguish between need satisfaction, need deprivation, and need thwarting
3. Understand the universal vs. culturally-specific nature of basic needs and examine cross-cultural evidence
4. Examine empirical evidence for the necessity of each need and their interactive effects

Prerequisites: Topic 1 (Historical Foundations and Theoretical Origins of SDT)

PKB Integration: The basic needs are the axiomatic foundation of SDT - everything else builds from here. This note will become a central hub with connections to [[Well-being]], [[Human Development]], [[Eudaimonia]], [[Cross-Cultural Psychology]], and all six SDT mini-theories.
</topic_context>

<pedagogical_approach>
Report Type: First-Principles + Analytical
Reasoning: The three basic needs function as axioms in SDT - they are not derived from other principles but serve as the foundation from which the theory builds. First-principles reasoning helps you understand WHY these specific needs matter and HOW they function as psychological nutrients. Analytical examination of the empirical evidence develops critical evaluation skills and helps you assess the strength of SDT's foundational claims.
</pedagogical_approach>

<task_specification>
Generate a comprehensive academic report on the Three Basic Psychological Needs that:

1. **Establishes First Principles** (First-Principles): Begin by explaining what makes a need "basic" according to SDT, using the analogy of physical nutrients. Build up from fundamental assumptions about human nature (organismic perspective, innate growth tendencies) to show why autonomy, competence, and relatedness specifically are proposed as universal needs

2. **Deeply Defines Each Need**: For autonomy, competence, and relatedness:
   - Provide precise SDT definitions
   - Explain common misconceptions (e.g., autonomy ≠ independence)
   - Describe what satisfaction, deprivation, and thwarting of each need looks like
   - Examine how each need relates to intrinsic motivation and well-being

3. **Analyzes the Empirical Evidence** (Analytical): Critically examine research supporting each need's universality:
   - Cross-cultural studies testing whether needs predict well-being across cultures
   - Experimental studies manipulating need satisfaction
   - Meta-analytic evidence for need-outcome relationships
   - Challenges and criticisms (e.g., cultural variability in autonomy)

4. **Explores Interactive Effects**: How do the three needs work together? Are they additive or multiplicative? What happens when some needs are satisfied and others thwarted?

5. **Includes PKB Capture Guidance**: Identify concepts for wiki-linking ([[Autonomy]], [[Competence]], [[Relatedness]], [[Eudaimonic Well-being]], [[Need Satisfaction]], [[Need Thwarting]], etc.), suggest tags (#basic-needs, #foundational-concepts), and connection points

6. **Provides Real-World Examples**: Concrete scenarios showing each need in action across life domains (education, work, relationships, health)

7. **Identifies Controversies and Open Questions**: Address debates about cultural universality, measurement challenges, and whether these three needs are truly exhaustive

Target Depth: Deep and comprehensive - this is a cornerstone reference note
Expected Length: 3000-4000 words
</task_specification>

<quality_criteria>
The report should:
- Be immediately usable in an Obsidian vault with proper metadata and formatting
- Demonstrate rigorous first-principles reasoning from organismic assumptions to specific needs
- Present balanced analytical evaluation of empirical evidence (strengths and limitations)
- Clearly distinguish autonomy from related constructs (independence, individualism, freedom)
- Include specific empirical examples and study findings
- Connect needs to broader themes in motivation and well-being
- Suggest areas for deeper exploration
</quality_criteria>
```

### Prompt for Topic 3: Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation - The Core Distinction

```
<topic_context>
Research Area: Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation - The Core Distinction in Self-Determination Theory
Learning Objectives:
1. Articulate the fundamental difference between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation with precision
2. Understand the "undermining effect" of extrinsic rewards on intrinsic motivation and its boundary conditions
3. Examine conditions under which extrinsic motivation can support (rather than undermine) autonomy
4. Apply the intrinsic/extrinsic distinction to analyze real-world motivational scenarios

Prerequisites: Topics 1-2 (Historical Foundations, Basic Psychological Needs)

PKB Integration: This topic refines your understanding of SDT's most central distinction and connects to notes on [[Reward Systems]], [[Incentive Design]], [[Educational Psychology]], [[Performance Management]], and [[Behavior Change]]. It prepares you for understanding the internalization continuum in Organismic Integration Theory.
</topic_context>

<pedagogical_approach>
Report Type: Expository + Case Studies
Reasoning: The intrinsic/extrinsic motivation distinction is nuanced and easily misunderstood, requiring clear, precise explanation - the hallmark of expository teaching. However, abstract definitions alone are insufficient; case studies ground the concepts in concrete scenarios and help you recognize these motivation types across diverse real-world contexts.
</pedagogical_approach>

<task_specification>
Generate a comprehensive academic report on Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation that:

1. **Provides Crystal-Clear Definitions** (Expository):
   - Define intrinsic motivation: engaging in behavior for its inherent satisfaction
   - Define extrinsic motivation: engaging in behavior as a means to a separable outcome
   - Explain perceived locus of causality and how it distinguishes the two
   - Clarify what intrinsic motivation is NOT (e.g., not just "fun" or "enjoyable")

2. **Explains the Undermining Effect**:
   - Present the empirical phenomenon: how and why external rewards can reduce intrinsic motivation
   - Detail the mechanisms (shift in perceived locus of causality, competence vs. control information)
   - Identify boundary conditions: when do rewards undermine, and when might they support intrinsic motivation?
   - Connect to Cognitive Evaluation Theory (mini-theory preview)

3. **Distinguishes Quality from Quantity of Motivation**:
   - Explain why SDT focuses on the quality (type) of motivation, not just amount
   - Describe outcomes associated with intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation (persistence, creativity, well-being, performance)
   - Address the misconception that "extrinsic = bad" (preview internalization)

4. **Applies Through Case Studies**:
   - Education: Student learning a subject out of interest vs. for grades
   - Work: Employee intrinsically engaged in tasks vs. working for bonuses
   - Health: Exercise motivated by enjoyment vs. appearance goals

### Prompt for Topic 4: The Six Mini-Theories - SDT's Theoretical Ecosystem

```
<topic_context>
Research Area: The Six Mini-Theories of Self-Determination Theory - Understanding SDT's Theoretical Ecosystem
Learning Objectives:
1. Master all six mini-theories: Cognitive Evaluation Theory (CET), Organismic Integration Theory (OIT), Causality Orientations Theory (COT), Basic Psychological Needs Theory (BPNT), Goal Contents Theory (GCT), and Relationships Motivation Theory (RMT)
2. Understand how each mini-theory addresses specific motivational phenomena and research questions
3. Recognize when to apply each mini-theory to analyze motivational contexts
4. Synthesize the mini-theories into a coherent, integrated understanding of SDT

Prerequisites: Topics 1-3 (Historical Foundations, Basic Needs, Intrinsic/Extrinsic Motivation)

PKB Integration: This is the most complex and comprehensive SDT topic. It will create numerous atomic notes for each mini-theory and regulation type, all connecting to the central [[Self-Determination Theory MOC]]. Links will extend to [[Individual Differences]], [[Goal Setting]], [[Attachment Theory]], [[Personality Psychology]], and domain-specific applications.
</topic_context>

<pedagogical_approach>
Report Type: Systems Analysis + Analytical
Reasoning: The six mini-theories form an interconnected ecosystem where each addresses a distinct facet of motivation while contributing to a unified whole. Systems thinking helps you see both the unique functions and the relationships between mini-theories. Analytical examination ensures you understand each theory's specific contribution, empirical basis, and application scope.
</pedagogical_approach>

<task_specification>
Generate a comprehensive academic report on the Six Mini-Theories of SDT that:

1. **Provides Ecosystem Overview** (Systems Analysis):
   - Explain how the mini-theories work together as an integrated system
   - Describe the meta-theory that unifies all six mini-theories
   - Create a conceptual map showing relationships between mini-theories

2. **Deep-Dives Each Mini-Theory** (one section per theory):
   
   **Cognitive Evaluation Theory (CET)**:
   - Core question: How do external events affect intrinsic motivation?
   - Key concepts: Informational vs. controlling aspects of events, autonomy and competence support
   - Empirical findings: Effects of rewards, feedback, choice, deadlines on intrinsic motivation
   
   **Organismic Integration Theory (OIT)**:
   - Core question: How does extrinsic motivation vary in quality, and how does internalization occur?
   - Key concepts: The continuum of motivation (external, introjected, identified, integrated regulation)
   - Process of internalization: How external values become self-endorsed
   
   **Causality Orientations Theory (COT)**:
   - Core question: How do people differ in their general motivational orientations?
   - Key concepts: Autonomy, control, and impersonal orientations as individual differences
   - Implications: How orientations shape interpretation of social contexts
   
   **Basic Psychological Needs Theory (BPNT)**:
   - Core question: What are the universal requirements for psychological health?
   - Key concepts: Elaborates on autonomy, competence, relatedness across cultures and contexts
   - Cross-cultural applications and debates
   
   **Goal Contents Theory (GCT)**:
   - Core question: Does the content of goals matter as much as the reasons for pursuing them?
   - Key concepts: Intrinsic goals (growth, relationships, community) vs. extrinsic goals (wealth, fame, image)
   - Outcomes: Different well-being effects of intrinsic vs. extrinsic goal pursuit
   
   **Relationships Motivation Theory (RMT)**:
   - Core question: How does SDT apply to close relationships and attachment?
   - Key concepts: Need satisfaction in relationships, autonomy support in relational contexts
   - Connection to attachment theory

3. **Analyzes Integration Points** (Systems Analysis):
   - How does OIT build on CET?
   - How do COT orientations influence the internalization process in OIT?
   - How does GCT interact with BPNT (do intrinsic goals better satisfy needs)?

4. **Includes PKB Capture Guidance**: Extensive wiki-linking for all regulation types, orientations, and goal contents; tags for #mini-theories, #theoretical-integration; connection points throughout psychology

5. **Provides Application Examples**: For each mini-theory, show how it analyzes a real-world scenario

6. **Addresses Theoretical Debates**: Controversies, unanswered questions, and areas of active research for each mini-theory

Target Depth: Extremely comprehensive - this is the theoretical heart of SDT
Expected Length: 5000-7000 words (this is a major reference document)
</task_specification>

<quality_criteria>
The report should:
- Be immediately usable in an Obsidian vault with extensive wiki-linking and clear structure
- Demonstrate systems-level understanding of how mini-theories interrelate
- Provide analytical depth on each individual mini-theory
- Include concrete examples showing each mini-theory in action
- Clearly distinguish what makes each mini-theory unique and what it contributes to SDT
- Create foundation for understanding all subsequent SDT applications
- Suggest multiple avenues for further exploration
</quality_criteria>
