### Ideas
**Self Questioning Routines for**:
- Critical Thinking
- Metacognition
- Stoicism

> Effective critical thinking instruction requires several elements often absent from conventional curricula.
> First, explicit teaching of **reasoning skills**: probability and statistics, scientific methodology, informal logic, argument analysis, and recognition of common cognitive biases.
> Second, cultivation of **thinking dispositions**: intellectual curiosity, open-mindedness, reflective skepticism, intellectual humility, and the propensity to engage in effortful thinking rather than accepting the first answer that comes to mind.
> Third, development of **high-quality mindware**: not just domain knowledge but understanding of how knowledge is established, what distinguishes reliable from unreliable sources, and frameworks for evaluating claims. This includes explicit instruction about common sources of contaminated mindware and how to resist their influence.

<span style='color: #DC2626; font-weight: 500; font-style: italic;'>Critical Thinking Frameworks Guidance</span>: Use **Paul-Elder** for systematic analysis of any specific instance of thinking—dissecting arguments, evaluating claims, examining assumptions. Use **Facione** for comprehensive skill development and assessment, ensuring both cognitive competence and dispositional readiness. Use **Bloom** for curriculum sequencing and learning objective formulation, building progressively more complex cognitive skills. Use **ACER** for connecting critical thinking to practical decision-making contexts, especially in professional or civic domains.

I need a comprehensive reference note on Bloom's Taxonomy.
Specifically using **Bloom's Taxonomy** for curriculum sequencing and learning objective formulation, and in building progressively more complex cognitive skills.

> <u>When analyzing thinking, ask these essential questions:</u>
> 
> - **What exactly am I trying to accomplish?** 
> 	- State the purpose <span style='color: #ff0000;'>explicitly</span> and <span style='color: #ff0000;'>precisely</span>.
> - **Is my purpose clearly defined, or is it vague and unfocused?** 
> 	- <span style='color: #ff0000;'>Vague</span> purposes produce <span style='color: #ff0000;'>vague</span> thinking.
> - **Is my purpose trivial or significant?** 
> 	- Purpose determines the importance of the <span style='color: #ff0000;'>entire</span> reasoning process.
> - **Is my purpose realistic and achievable?** 
> 	- Unrealistic purposes lead to frustration and failure.
> - **Do I have more than one purpose?** 
> 	- Multiple conflicting purposes <span style='color: #ff0000;'>fragment</span> thinking.
> 		- **If I have conflicting purposes, which takes priority?** 
> 			- Prioritization <span style='color: #ff0000;'>clarifies</span> thinking.
> - **Is my stated purpose my actual purpose?** 
> 	- Hidden agendas <span style='color: #ff0000;'>undermine</span> intellectual integrity.
> - **Is my purpose ethical and fair-minded?** 
> 	- Purposes can be intellectually clear yet morally problematic.
> > [!key-claim] The Power of Question Formulation
> > Paul and Elder emphasize that <span style='font-size: 1.3em;'><span style='color: #ff0000;'>how you frame the question dramatically constrains possible answers</span></span>. A poorly formulated question—vague, loaded, biased, or falsely dichotomous—makes good reasoning impossible regardless of subsequent cognitive work. Conversely, a well-formulated question—clear, precise, neutral, and appropriately scoped—creates the conditions for excellent reasoning.
> [! ] #### Critical Questions for Identifying and Evaluating Questions
> 
> <span style='font-size: 1.3em;'><span style='color: #ff0000;'>When analyzing the question at issue, ask</span></span>:
> - **Identification Questions**:
> 	- *What is the key question I am addressing?*
> 	- *Is this question the central question, or is it peripheral?*
> 	- *Am I addressing multiple questions that should be separated?*
> 	- *Am I treating a complex question as if it were simple?*
> - **Clarity Questions**:
> 	- *Is my question clear and precisely stated?*
> 	- *Could someone else understand exactly what I'm asking?*
> 	- *Does my question use ambiguous terms that need definition?*
> - **Complexity Questions**:
> 	- *Is this question purely factual, conceptual, evaluative, or some combination?* 
> 	- *What type of answer does this question require—empirical evidence, logical analysis, value judgment?* 
> 	- *Have I broken a complex question into component questions?*
> - **Bias Questions**:
> 	- *Is my question loaded or slanted toward a particular answer?*
> 	- *Does my question contain hidden assumptions?*
> 	- *Am I asking a genuine open question, or merely a rhetorical one?*

>[! ] #### Critical Questions for Evaluating Information
> When assessing the information element in reasoning, ask:
> - **Identification Questions**:
> 	- *What information am I using to address this question?*
> 	- *What information do I need that I don't yet have?*
> 	- *Is my information primarily empirical, testimonial, statistical, or theoretical?*
> - **Quality Questions**:
> 	- *Is my information accurate?*
> 	- *How can I verify it?*
> 	- *Is my information relevant to the question at issue?*
> 	- *Is my information sufficient to support strong conclusions, or do I need more?*
> 	- *Is my information biased or one-sided?*
> 	- *Have I sought information that challenges my preferred conclusions?*
> - **Source Questions**:
> 	- *Where does this information come from?*
> 	- *Is the source credible and reliable?*
> 	- Does the source have biases or conflicts of interest?
> 	- Am I relying on multiple independent sources or a single source?
> - **Completeness Questions**:
> 	- *Have I considered all relevant information?*
> 	- *What information might I be ignoring or overlooking?*
> 	- *Am I aware of contradictory information?*
> 	- *Have I examined information that challenges my position?*

> [! ] #### Critical Questions for Evaluating Inferences
> 
> When analyzing inferences and interpretations, ask:
> 
> **Identification Questions**: 
> *What conclusions am I drawing?*
> *What am I inferring from this information?* 
> *How am I interpreting this data? What alternative interpretations exist?*
> 
> **Logical Questions**: 
> *Do my conclusions follow logically from my information?* 
> *Is my inference valid?* 
> *Have I made logical leaps?* 
> *Could someone reach different conclusions from the same information?*
> 
> **Strength Questions**: 
> *Is my inference strong or weak?*
> *Do I have sufficient information to support strong conclusions?*
> *Am I inferring beyond what my evidence warrants?*
> *Where am I most uncertain in my reasoning?*
> 
> **Alternative Questions**:
> *What alternative inferences could be drawn from this information?*
> *Have I considered competing interpretations?*
> *Why is my interpretation superior to alternatives?*
> *What would it take to change my interpretation?*
