## Introduction

[Incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading "Incremental reading") is the [fastest way of reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/How_can_I_read_faster%3F "How can I read faster?"). Despite the speed of reading, incremental reading minimizes [cognitive load](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Cognitive_load "Cognitive load") and nearly eliminates the [problem of forgetting](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Problem_of_forgetting "Problem of forgetting"). This short texts explains advantages of incremental reading. It is best suited for incremental reading beginners who know how incremental reading works, but are still skeptical of its powers.

In short, in [incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading "Incremental reading"), you learn fast, you acquire massive loads of knowledge, retain memories for life, remember almost all what you have learned, understand things better, develop harmoniously in all directions, enhance your creativity, and more. All those advantages can be achieved while [having fantastic fun](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Pleasure_of_learning "Pleasure of learning")! If this sounds too good to be true, please read more below or just give it a [solid try](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_for_Windows "SuperMemo for Windows").

## Massive learning

[Incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading "Incremental reading") offers a possibility of studying a huge number of subjects in parallel. In traditional reading, very often, one book or academic subject must be completed before studying another. With incremental reading, there is virtually no limit on how many subjects you can study at the same time. The volume of processed knowledge can be staggering. Only the availability of time and your memory capacity will keep massive learning in check.

## Lifetime memories

As incremental reading is based on [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition "Spaced repetition"), all memories that you form while learning will be indefinitely [protected from forgetting](http://super-memory.com/english/princip.htm). Incremental reading requires continual review of knowledge. Depending on the volume of knowledge flow in the program, the time between reading individual portions of the same article may extend from days to months and even years. **[SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo "SuperMemo") provides the foundation of incremental reading, which requires stable memories that would not fade between the bursts of reading**.

## High retention

In [incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading "Incremental reading"), the review of the learning material is governed by a [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition "Spaced repetition") algorithm known as the [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo "SuperMemo") method. The algorithm ensures 95% knowledge retention by default. That fraction can be increased at the cost of higher time expenditure (i.e. more frequent review). Recall can also be reduced to increase the overall speed of learning. In heavily overloaded collections of learning material, 95% retention figure refers only to the set of top-priority [questions](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Cloze_deletion "Cloze deletion"). To save time, low priority material may be reviewed less frequently, resulting in lower retention.

## Comprehension

One of the limiting factors in acquiring new knowledge is the barrier of understanding. Building knowledge in your brain is like [assembling a jigsaw puzzle](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Jigsaw_puzzle_metaphor "Jigsaw puzzle metaphor"). Some pieces cannot be placed in the puzzle before the others. Some pieces capitalize on others. There is no point in memorizing facts about *Higgs boson* before you learn what the *standard model* is and that, in turn, should follow the general understanding of *particle physics* which itself requires some *ABC of physics*. In [incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading "Incremental reading"), if you encounter a text related to *Higgs boson* you can manually delay it until the time you hope your *Physics ABC* will provide the ground for understanding the boson. In traditional reading, you would just waste your time on reviewing *Higgs boson* material just because you would not have tools to effectively reschedule and reprioritize your reading in the middle of a longer article. Traditionally, your decision to skip the material would provide no definite way of coming back to the skipped material in the future. With [incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading "Incremental reading"), you waste no time on reading material you do not understand. You can safely skip portions of material and return to them in the future. You become the master of the conscious knowledge building process. You can gradually build understanding of complex phenomena.

All written materials, depending on the reader's knowledge, pose a degree of difficulty in accurately interpreting their meaning. This is particularly visible in highly specialist scientific papers that use a sophisticated symbol-rich language. A symbol-rich language is a language that gains conciseness by the use of highly specialist vocabulary and notational conventions. For an average reader, symbol-rich language may exponentially raise the bar of lexical competence (i.e. knowledge of vocabulary required to gain understanding). [Incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading "Incremental reading") makes it possible to delay the processing of those articles, paragraphs or sentences that require prior knowledge of concepts that are not known at the moment of reading. The processing of the learning material will only take place then when the new information begins to slot in comfortably in the fabric of the reader's knowledge. You can then gradually proceed through this material and gradually build the understanding from basic or simple facts towards details or more complex components of knowledge. You will build understanding, resolve contradictions and ultimately creatively discover new truths about the learned material. Over time, you will optimize the structure of knowledge in your mind in terms of coherence, integrity, and representation. [Incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading "Incremental reading") will make it possible to tackle the hardest material that might otherwise seem unreadable.

## Dendritic progress

Instead of focusing on a single subject of study, the student will review dozens of subject areas in a single day. Instead of monopolizing her knowledge with a single area of expertise, she will harmoniously deepen all facets of her knowledge in proportion to needs and/or interests. The growth of the [knowledge tree](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Knowledge_tree "Knowledge tree") will also be guided by the present level of understanding of individual subjects, in proportion to the growth of the supporting knowledge, and specialist terminology. Instead of growing a few thick branches, the [knowledge tree](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Knowledge_tree "Knowledge tree") will grow twigs in all possible directions while still adding bulk to the trunk and main boughs. Incremental reading is inherently incapable of producing medical experts who have never heard of the [Kuiper Belt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_belt), or astronomers who have no idea what constitutes a basic healthy diet. [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo "SuperMemo") helps you prioritize knowledge in various fields. It also helps you fine-tune the balance between specialization and general knowledge. Uniform and dendritic growth of knowledge in SuperMemo prevents tunnel vision.

## Creativity

The key to creativity is an association of remote ideas. By studying multiple subjects in unpredictable order, you will increase your power to associate ideas. This will immensely improve your creativity. [Incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading "Incremental reading") may be compared to brainstorming with yourself. SuperMemo will throw at you various articles, paragraphs, statements, and [questions](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Cloze_deletion "Cloze deletion") in a most unexpected order. In the long run, the greatest creative advantage comes from knowledge permanently stored in your memory (as opposed to knowledge that you get from [Google](https://google.com/)). It is only a matter of creative effort and invested time before different pieces of knowledge can be associated to form new quality. This will also provide your brain with an entertaining form of mental training that will be highly appreciated in all forms of professions based on intellectual performance.

With incremental mail processing, it is also possible to mesh your learning, creative writing, and creative problem solving with a creative mail exchange with other people. This may appear helpful in collective problem solving or in complex projects when you need to strike a balance between focused individual work and pulling the team brains together. I call this process: **incremental brainstorming**. Incremental brainstorming is slower, but it does not need synchronization (circadian rhythm, time zones, motivation, etc.), and you do not need to interrupt each other's work. Incremental brainstorming will never replace face-to-face interactive collaboration; however, it has many advantages associated with incremental reading (creativity, [prioritization](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/#Prioritization), [attention](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/#Attention), [meticulousness](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/#Meticulousness), long-term viability, etc.). It may provide an excellent knowledge-based supplement or be your best creative collaboration tool when working at a distance (esp. via different time zones). The creative process is unpredictable, and when you hit your best ideas when the rest of the team is asleep, it makes a good sense to strike the iron while hot: employ creative elaboration and send your idea out. The most advanced form of brainstorming with yourself is [neural creativity](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Neural_creativity "Neural creativity"), which employs [incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading "Incremental reading") in a process of *[spreading activation](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spreading_activation "Spreading activation")* that mimics the way a genius knowledgeable mind works: in slow motion, and with a vastly expanded knowledge bank.

For technical details see: [Problem solving in SuperMemo](https://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Creativity_and_problem_solving_in_SuperMemo).

## Consistency

Contradiction and chaos in learning materials are inevitable. They come from bad sources, errors, from disagreements in science, or from the fact that you start the process from importing a set of unrelated or even chaotic articles describing a studied complex problem.

If your learning materials contain contradictory information, your brain will quickly alert you to this fact. In classical learning, you would often relearn new facts that would contradict earlier learned facts. Then you would relearn the older version again and this wasteful cycle might repeat at infinitum. [Interference](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Interference "Interference") that comes from contradiction is one of the prime causes of [forgetting](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Forgetting_curve "Forgetting curve"). In [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo "SuperMemo"), interference will also take place, however, there will be two mechanisms that will turn chaos and contradiction into a self-limiting condition. The first mechanism relies on **high retention of knowledge** in [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo "SuperMemo"). This will often make you instantaneously spot the contradiction: *Wait a minute! I have already learned this fact and the answer was different!* Unfortunately, even SuperMemo isn't hermetic to contradiction (your retention actually never reaches 100%). The second mechanism is the **convergence of contradictory material** in time. If you, for example, learn two different answers to *What is the size of human population?*, say, *5.5 billion* and *6 billion*, you will naturally provide a wrong answer to one of these questions. Once you relearn it the new way, you will provide a wrong answer to the other question. Review intervals for these two contradictory messages will get shorter with each relearning cycle. Review of contradictory questions will converge in time. Sooner or later, the red alert will be raised by your brain. You will quickly resolve the difference and delete the question you determine to be wrong. Similar process will affect hazy or incompletely specified information. Your knowledge will grow in [consistency](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Consistency "Consistency") over time.

In scientific research, acquiring engineering knowledge, studying a narrow topic of interest, etc. we are constantly faced with a chaos of disparate and often contradictory statements. By introducing the chaos of new research into [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo "SuperMemo"), you gradually locate contradictions and strive at building better and more consistent models in your memory. [Incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading "Incremental reading") [stochastically](http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=stochastic) [juxtaposes](http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=juxtapose) pieces of information coming from various sources and uses the associative qualities of human memory to emphasize and then resolve contradiction. You will quickly lean towards theories that are better supported by research findings. Those supported poorly will be less firm and will often cause recall problems. Naturally, it may happen that you wish to learn contradictory statements too. For example, the opinions of dissenting scientists. In those cases, SuperMemo will help you emphasize the need of rich context. You will label individual statements with their proponent names or with their school of thought.

## Coherence

[Incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading "Incremental reading"), as all forms of self-directed self-learning, proceeds with the guidance of the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive "Learn drive"). As learn drive is determined by individual [knowledge valuations](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Knowledge_valuation_network "Knowledge valuation network") and semantic proximity, it naturally leads to knowledge with a high degree of [coherence](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Coherence "Coherence"). The exploration pathways in incremental reading are highly dendritic, and their structure is strongly determined by the material that is being processed. This way, while reading about X, you can jump to Y, and then to Z. Even if X, Y, Z are not closely connected, this progression helps establish natural links that contribute to coherence. Semantic proximity or meaningful connectedness may have a strong impact on [memory consolidation in sleep](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Memory_optimization_in_sleep "Memory optimization in sleep"). According to [Neurostatistical Model of Memory](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Neurostatistical_Model_of_Memory "Neurostatistical Model of Memory"), knowledge [coherence](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Coherence "Coherence") is essential for building long-term memory [stability](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stability "Stability").

## Stresslessness

Observers and new users of SuperMemo believe that complexity of [incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading "Incremental reading") must make it stressful. Some report that [even reading about incremental reading is stressful](http://super-memory.com/help/il.htm#Observer.27s_Opinion:_Why_I_would_not_use_incremental_learning.3F). However, even though complexity always leads to a degree of stress or confusion, in the long-term, the opposite is true: SuperMemo helps you combat stress. Stressless learning is one of the greatest advantages of incremental reading. All the advantages listed in this section contribute to the sense of fun and relaxation. However, SuperMemo's ability to combat information overload might be the chief factor. Conversely, low stress levels have a miraculous impact on the effectiveness of learning.

Not everyone is stressed with information overload. There is a precondition for experiencing stress of having too much to read or too much to learn: obsessive hunger for knowledge, fear of not being able to keep up, pressing need for new knowledge, etc. This precondition is met in a great proportion of the general population according to a number of studies, and is actually less likely in younger individuals, including students, who are shielded from stress by their less crystallized motivation for learning.

The term *Information Fatigue Syndrome* has been coined recently to refer to stress coming from problems with managing overwhelming information. Some consequences of IFS listed by Dr. David Lewis, a British psychologist, include: anxiety, tension, procrastination, time-wasting, loss of job satisfaction, self-doubt, psychosomatic stress, breakdown of relationships, reduced analytical capacity, etc. The information era tends to overwhelm us with the amount of information we feel compelled to process. [Incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading "Incremental reading") does not require all-or-nothing choices on articles to read. All-or-nothing choices are stressful! *Can I afford to skip this article? For months I haven't had time to read this article!* etc. SuperMemo helps you prioritize and skip articles partially (by decision) or automatically (i.e. behind the scenes). Oftentimes, reading 3% of an article may provide 50% of its reading value. Reading of articles may be delayed without your participation, i.e. not by stressful procrastination, but by a sheer competition with other pieces of information on the basis of their [priority](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Priority_queue "Priority queue"). In [incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading "Incremental reading"), instead of hesitating or procrastinating, you simply prioritize.

If you happen to open a dozen of tabs in your web browser, you will often be stressed about the optimum course of action. You might be late for sleep, or late for work, and yet you do not want to lose the information. In SuperMemo, you just import and prioritize. Or just import. Nothing is lost. You will encounter the imported material as soon as your learning time allocations permit. Similarly, you can clear your 1,000 pieces mail Inbox in minutes with all pieces of mail well prioritized and scheduled for review.

Once you know you can rely on [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo "SuperMemo") in presenting review material for you, you can eliminate the stress and anxiety related to having too much to study or too much to read. You will never manage to read or learn all that you would hope for, but you will at least not lose sleep over planning and scheduling. SuperMemo is a promise of the best use of your potential. With this conviction, you can devote all your energy to comprehension, analysis and good recall of the learned material.

SuperMemo helps you take away a big deal of information overload stress. In a typical IFS stress therapy, you will see that scrupulous notes, ordering one's desk, planning one's work, keeping a calendar of appointments, etc. all have a strong therapeutic value. SuperMemo does exactly the same: it helps you keep a scrupulous and well-prioritized record of what you want to read and takes away stressful chaos from the process of acquiring information and learning the collected material. SuperMemo eliminates disorder and the ensuing uncertainty that often characterizes wild searches for information on the net.

## Attention

Human brain has an in-built limit on the attention span. We all get bored with things. This is particularly visible in kids. Limited attention helps [maximize the learning input](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive "Learn drive"). This is why most toys have a short lifespan, and other kids' toys seem always more interesting. The same is true of reading. Even the best articles can become taxing if they get too long. Millions of people do a daily channel zapping on TV. This absurd activity is driven precisely by the craving for [dense action and information variety](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learntropy "Learntropy"). A gripping movie goes "too slow" for a typical channel zapper. This is why he or she prefers to watch three movies at the same time (even though the coherence of the plot of each will suffer). [Incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading "Incremental reading") is a perfect remedy to the limited attention span. Even a single unlucky paragraph in an article may greatly reduce your [enthusiasm for reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Pleasure_of_learning "Pleasure of learning"). If you stumble against a few frustrating paragraphs, you may gradually develop a dislike of reading a particular article. You may even become fed up with reading for the entire evening.

In [incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading "Incremental reading"), once you sense any sign of boredom or distraction, you can jump to the next article with mostly positive side effects (expressed mainly in better memories produced by [spaced learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition "Spaced repetition")). Unlike it is the case with channel zapping, you won't miss any information. Just the opposite, you will maximize attention per paragraph. Your attention to the same piece of information may depend on your mood, amount of prior reading, today's interest that may depend on the piece of news you heard on the morning radio, etc. With [incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading "Incremental reading"), you can fit your best attention to each individual piece of reading. You can change the approach depending on your [circadian status](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Natural_creativity_cycle "Natural creativity cycle") (i.e. the time of the day, mental energy, etc.). You can deprioritize articles that undermine attention. You can split intimidating articles into more manageable portions. The boost in attention is one of the main reasons why [incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading "Incremental reading") is more fun than ordinary reading.

## Memory consolidation

Everything we learn must be reviewed from time to time in order to be remembered. If you read an article in portions spaced in time, you already begin the consolidation of memory which may save you lots of time. In traditional reading, you would need to read the whole article, and then to review the article later several times. With earlier versions of [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo "SuperMemo"), you would need to read the whole article, and then only review the most important parts of the article as questions and answer. Now you can begin the consolidation-review cycle already during reading! [Incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading "Incremental reading") combines the process of extracting pieces of valuable knowledge with memory consolidation. This pre-consolidation will often dramatically reduce the number of repetitions required before your material gets to be reviewed in intervals of months and years. By the time you convert parts of the material into [clozes](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Cloze_deletion "Cloze deletion"), your knowledge will have already been consolidated pretty well. This consolidation will be based on solid context, a degree of redundancy (that helps recall), and an [easy-to-remember formulation](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/20_rules "20 rules") based on [cloze deletion](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Cloze_deletion "Cloze deletion"). Extracting pieces of information from a larger text provides your knowledge with all the relevant context. This incremental process of jelling out comprehension produces an enhanced sense of meaning and applicability of individual pieces of information. Semantically equivalent pieces of knowledge may be consolidated in varying contexts adding additional angles to their associative power. In other words, not only will you remember better. You will also be able to view the same information from different perspectives.

## Prioritization

You always have a long queue of articles to read, and there are always more articles to read than you can ever hope to remember. In [incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading "Incremental reading"), you can precisely determine the [priority](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Priority_queue "Priority queue") of each article, paragraph, sentence or question. Evaluating articles and prioritizing them is difficult because you cannot do a good evaluation without actually reading a part of the article in question. In [incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading "Incremental reading"), you can read the introduction and then decide when to read the rest. If an article is extremely valuable or interesting, you can process it entirely at once. Other articles can slowly scramble through the learning process. Yet others may ultimately be deleted. The prioritization will continue while you are reading the article. If the evaluation of quality or content changes while reading, so will the reading-review schedule.

Prioritization tools will ensure that important pieces of information will receive better processing. This will maximize the value of your reading time. This will also reduce the impact of material overflow on retention. You will always remember the desired proportion of your top-priority material. While the lesser priority material may suffer more from the overflow and be remembered less accurately. Priority of articles is not set in stone. You can modify it manually while reading in proportion to the value you extract from a given article. The priority will also change automatically each time you generate article extracts. It will change if you delay or advance scheduled reading. The priority of extracts is determined by the priority of articles. The priority of questions and answers produced from individual sentences is determined by their parenting extract priority. Multiple prioritization tools will help you effectively deal with massive changes in your learning focus.

**Efficient fishing for pieces of golden knowledge** is one of best things about [incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading "Incremental reading").

Incremental readers can [beat speed readers](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/How_can_I_read_faster%3F "How can I read faster?") in the speed of reading! This is true even for relative beginners with little or no speed-reading training. The caveat: all that is possible at the cost of delayed comprehension. In speed-reading, you always need to worry about the comprehension level. High comprehension is where speed-reading skills are vital. However, in [incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading "Incremental reading"), you can quickly skim through less important portions of the text without worrying you will miss a detail. The skimmed fragment will be scheduled for later review. You can optionally determine when the review will happen and at what priority (low priority review may be delayed further, often automatically). You can quickly jump from paragraph to paragraph, get the overall picture, mark fragments for later reading, mark fragments for detailed study, etc. This speed-reading method, with a bit of training, is stress free. You will eliminate the greatest bottleneck of speed-reading: fear of missing important pieces of information. When you come back to the skimmed fragments in the future, they may have already become irrelevant or less important. That is one of a savings in time generated by [incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading "Incremental reading"). You always focus on top priority material and you spend little time worrying about things that are left for later reading. **[incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading "Incremental reading") is speed-reading without the loss of comprehension**. Once you speed-read the entire article, you can slowly digest it again from the very beginning in the incremental reading process. Needless to say, speed-reading does not come close to [incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading "Incremental reading") when it comes to long-term retention. Memories are always subject to forgetting. All valuable information that you collect while reading may be forgotten at any time. Pieces that would be retained without SuperMemo (e.g. through regular use) produce minimum workload. Other pieces will allow you to never need to come back to the article in question. In conclusion, all knowledge that you need in the long-run, should be best acquired via [incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading "Incremental reading"). Traditional reading can still be used for entertainment, temporary knowledge (e.g. how to install a sound board), curiosity (e.g. news), etc. This is not to say that speed-reading skills are not useful in [incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading "Incremental reading"). If you are already a solid speed-reader, you can add to your speed and comprehension with the help of [incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading "Incremental reading"). In the process, you will hone your skills further and become even a faster reader.

See also: [Speed-reading on steroids](http://super-memory.com/articles/speedread.htm), which also explains the bell-shaped curve of changes in the cost of topic review.

[Cloze deletion](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Cloze_deletion "Cloze deletion") is the fastest tool for converting short texts into questions that can be used in [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition "Spaced repetition"). In addition to massive imports, you can introduce your own rough notes into SuperMemo and later gradually convert them into well-structured knowledge. Less important material may remain unstructured and, as such, less well-remembered. You will see how passive notes gradually fade in your memory and how their individual components will need to be reinforced by formulating specific well-structured questions. You will make such reinforcement decisions on the one-by-one basis depending on the importance of the fading material and the degree of problems with recall. Naturally, due to a typical learning overflow, you will always neglect some portions of the material. This is how you will gain additional speed understood as the time invested per question. You will generate questions faster, re-formulate them with greater ease, and save additional time by neglecting less important material. This is prioritization via formulation. Less important material will remain in a less processed and messier state characterized by lower retention.

## Knowledge Darwinism

One of the best weapons against forgetting is connectedness and [coherence](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Coherence "Coherence"). Coherence minimizes [interference](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Interference "Interference"). With memories well placed in the overall structure of knowledge, review can proceed in widely spaced intervals. It is not unusual to retain some memories for a decade without documented review. One of the explanations for long memory survival might be [re-consolidation in sleep](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Memory_optimization_in_sleep "Memory optimization in sleep"). Such re-consolidation could only affect well connected memories. To build coherent memories, the student must primarily rely on his [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive "Learn drive"). Mnemonic techniques, for example based on visualization might be helpful too. However, there is probably no better approach than [knowledge darwinism](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Knowledge_darwinism "Knowledge darwinism"). Instead of memorizing question-answer pairs, the reader, in the process of [incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading "Incremental reading"), using his natural [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive "Learn drive") intuitions, marks keywords worth remembering. This often leads to redundancy in that the same semantically equivalent knowledge is stored using different contexts. Those contexts compete in the learning process for their appeal and priority. Their consolidation will be reflected in future reading by generating more or fewer similar [cloze deletions](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Cloze_deletion "Cloze deletion"). Those semantically equivalent and contextually varied pieces of knowledge will also compete for the best place in the coherent model of reality in student's mind. This redundancy and darwinism may partly play a role of knowledge review, and partly reduce the need for review by maximizing coherence of knowledge in that best fit pieces will have the best chance of surviving long-term in memory. Those surviving pieces will then boost the performance of the remaining items in their own contexts. This will further increase the abstraction, universality and usability of a given memory. This will also reduce the cost of learning despite the regular inflow of new [cloze deletions](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Cloze_deletion "Cloze deletion") in the learning process.

## Meticulousness

With well-prioritized stream of information, you are served knowledge in smaller chunks. This makes it possible to truly focus on most important pieces and discover things that would never get noticed in the mass of voluminous learning. Good attention brings meticulousness and creative discovery. In other words, this is a marriage of [prioritization](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/#Prioritization), [attention](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/#Attention), and [creativity](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/#Creativity_boost) advantages with a new twist: noticing things that are hard to notice in massive learning. Many readers of [SuperMemo Guru](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_Guru "SuperMemo Guru") complain that the texts are too long. In [incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading "Incremental reading"), the length of the text has no impact on priority. The brain as a chance to focus on the semantics and ignore irrelevant factors (such as font, advertising, length, formatting, clickbaits, etc.).

## Training

With massive [incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading "Incremental reading"), you will hone a set of skills that are vital for efficient learning. By repeating the same procedures over and over again, day in and day out, over the months and years, you will become a master of processing and retaining knowledge! **If you want things well done, do them often**. Here are some examples of skills that will get a boost, and change your learning:

- **Recognizing suitable texts** at a glance. Some texts are great for efficient reading, some are full of chaff and waffle. The more articles you need to preview and prioritize, the faster you can do it and the more accurate you become. This is an exercise in expert pattern recognition.
- **Formulating knowledge** efficiently. In terms of learning efficiency, the difference between [well-formulated](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/20_rules "20 rules") and ill-formulated knowledge may be as high as 1:10 or even 1:100. Some questions are mnemonic. Others are confusing. Some require 5-6 repetitions in a lifetime. Others permanently reside among memory leeches that come back for review and waste your precious time.
- **Mnemonic skills**. The more you try to remember, the better you know how to remember things fast and for long. Mnemonic skills can be developed in dedicated courses. They can also improve with each single piece of knowledge you formulate and memorize.
- **Speed-reading skills**. [Fast reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/How_can_I_read_faster%3F "How can I read faster?") is a hallmark of incremental reading. Traditional speed-reading is very different from speed-reading with SuperMemo. You nearly never need to worry about missing information. [Incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading "Incremental reading") carries none of the burdens of a typical hit-and-miss speed-reading. There is no limit on the speed of skimming. The more you skim, the better you skim. The more you hurry, the more you skim. Incremental reading accelerates your hunger for knowledge, and the speed at which you devour it.
- **Semantic skills**. The language is a jigsaw puzzle of words and phrases played on a set board of grammar. Understanding the language is vital for speed-reading where the structure of a sentence needs to be parsed in a fraction of a millisecond at a single glance. In [incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading "Incremental reading"), correct formulation of [clozes](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Cloze_deletion "Cloze deletion") will often require minor rewording. Like in a puzzle, you will need to shift a word from here to there, remove sections of sentences, insert context, change the tense, remove referential ambiguity, etc. Mastery of the grammatical sentence skeleton and the semantics will increase with every and each new [cloze](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Cloze_deletion "Cloze deletion") polished for long-term recall.
- **Prioritization skills**. New students, however smart, are often totally blind to the priority of knowledge. They are unable to judge the extent of their present and future knowledge. They find it difficult to differentiate gold from garbage. Seemingly precious knowledge becomes garbage if it does not pass the priority test that ensures it can ever be mastered. The lifetime capacity of the human brain is limited. Without understanding the limits, newcomers to incremental reading will often embark on a futile quest for mastering details that would steal room needed for memories that are essential to one's existence (professional and beyond). With every passing month and with the constant increase in the size of your knowledge, you will better understand your ultimate limits. Your knowledge selection skills will keep improving for years to come.
- **Editing and SuperMemo skills**. SuperMemo is complex. It takes months to fully explore. SuperMemo is also keyboard-oriented. The list of keyboard shortcuts is overwhelming. Only with the mastery of the keyboard and SuperMemo itself can you become a true pro of incremental reading who can whiz through dozens of articles per hour. You will edit dozens of little pieces of texts to optimally formulate your questions. Speed-reading and semantic skills, combined with editing skills will help you instantly mold the texts in your collection to suit your long-term goals.

## Knowledge database

Once your knowledge [collection](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Collection "Collection") grows rich in materials from various domains, you can use it before you use Google to search for information about a subject within the material that you already want to learn. The search result will not be as rich, but it will be far more focused on the areas of your interest. Instead of reading on the net, you can execute [subset learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Subset_learning "Subset learning") or [neural review](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Neural_review "Neural review"). This makes you learn new things while reading things you have already planned to read. A fun side effect of [subset learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Subset_learning "Subset learning") is that you discover things from the cross-section of areas of interest. For example, while reading about the structure of the brain, you learn a thing or two about a great scientist who happened to be mentioned in one of your neuroscience articles scheduled for reading. While doing [subset learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Subset_learning "Subset learning"), you will be able to reduce the future workload in many areas. **This is fun!**

Once you become proficient with SuperMemo you can use it as an all-encompasing archive of all your media files. Those files do not need to be part of the learning process, however, you can combine archiving functions with the incremental process (e.g. when annotating your family photo album). SuperMemo may be a great way to get rid of those dusty paper documents, tape recorder cassettes, CDs, photo albums, school notebooks, etc. You can archive this in dedicated folders on your computer and import it all to SuperMemo. Incremental processing of archive has many advantages. For example, while annotating family pictures from a hundred years ago, you can fill in the gaps in information by simple face recognition that may rely on a degree of learning or creative juxtaposition of photographs from different sources in close intervals. Incremental audio can also convert your music collection into jukebox that can maximize the fun of listening. There are millions of ways of sorting tracks on your media player device, by filename, by date, by annotation, by priority, by recent viewing. All that does not compare to the incremental review process. This is because the quality of your experience when processing music or photos is based on the same forgetting mechanisms that affect learning. You want to see or listen to some things more often than others, but not too often. Forgetting is the key to experiencing music or imagery or videos again and again with a heightened degree of fun, pleasure and, last but not least, learning.

The sense of productivity might be one of the most satisfying emotions. The [pleasure of learning](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Pleasure_of_learning "Pleasure of learning") is therapeutic (see: [Learning and depression](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learning_and_depression "Learning and depression")). [Incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading "Incremental reading") is highly enjoyable. The pleasure of learning magnifies the powers of reading. To experience the elation of incremental reading, you may need a few months of focused practice. You will first have to start with basic tools and techniques. Then you will need to master [knowledge representation skills](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/20_rules "20 rules"). Finally, you will need a couple of months of heavy-load incremental reading to perfect the details and develop your own *incremental reading philosophy*. You will also need to grow your [collection](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Collection "Collection") of materials because many of the advantages of incremental reading depend on the size of the collection. Last but not least, incremental reading requires good language skills, some touch-typing skills, and patience. Although the material is originally imported from electronic sources, it always needs to be molded, shortened, enriched with context clues, revised for clarity and grammar, explained (e.g. with ChatGPT), etc. The skills involved are not trivial and require some practice.

If you have used [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition "Spaced repetition") previously, you may have concluded that learning with [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo "SuperMemo") is boring due to its repetitive nature. Those who can compare the classic [SuperMemo](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo "SuperMemo") with [incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading "Incremental reading") will testify that incremental reading is by far more fun. In contrast to classic SuperMemo, where you focus on the review of the old material, [incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading "Incremental reading") interweaves the old with the new. [Novelty](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive "Learn drive") adds to the fun and the efficiency of learning. Incremental reading is far more challenging and colorful than plain old [spaced repetition](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spaced_repetition "Spaced repetition"). In addition to review and reading, you can import rich materials full of images, audio, and video to spice up your learning process.

After a longer while, you may even become [addicted](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Addiction_to_learning "Addiction to learning") to [incremental reading](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading "Incremental reading"). The statement " *[I do not read books](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Why_I_do_not_read_books "Why I do not read books")* " should no longer be considered an intellectual sin!
