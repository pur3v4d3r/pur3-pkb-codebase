> [!abstract]
> **Executive Overview**
> [[Obsidian URI]] is a custom [[URI Scheme]] (`obsidian://`) that transforms your PKB from a passive repository into an **active, programmable cognitive interface**. This protocol enables external applications, scripts, and automation tools to trigger actions within Obsidian—opening notes, creating content, executing searches, and invoking commands—without requiring manual interaction. For a cognitively-optimized knowledge system, URI integration represents the architectural bridge between your **[[Working Memory]]** constraints and **externalized cognition infrastructure**, enabling friction-free capture, retrieval, and synthesis workflows that align with how human memory and attention actually function.

> [!how-to-use-this]
> **Navigation Guide**
> This reference note is organized into 8 major sections covering all aspects of Obsidian URI from foundational concepts through cognitive science applications. Use the table of contents for quick navigation. Key implementation patterns are provided with Windows-specific [[PowerShell]] examples given your system configuration. Plugin recommendations (especially [[Advanced URI]]) extend native capabilities substantially.

# 🎯 1. Core Concepts & Foundational Understanding

## 1.1 What is Obsidian URI?

> [!definition]
> - **Key-Term**: [[URI Scheme]]
> - **Definition**: A [[Uniform Resource Identifier]] scheme is a standardized syntax for identifying resources and triggering actions. The `obsidian://` protocol is a **custom URI scheme** registered by Obsidian on your operating system, allowing any application capable of opening URLs to communicate with your vault.

Obsidian URI operates as an **inter-process communication (IPC) channel** between your knowledge management system and the broader computing environment. When Windows receives a request to open an `obsidian://` URL, it routes that request to the Obsidian application, which parses the URL parameters and executes the corresponding action.

> [!key-claim]
> **Central Principle**
> URI schemes represent the **lowest-friction automation primitive** available in modern operating systems. Unlike APIs requiring programming knowledge or plugins requiring Obsidian to be actively used, URIs can be triggered from *any* context—browser bookmarks, desktop shortcuts, scheduled tasks, email links, other applications, or voice assistants. This universality makes them the ideal foundation for a cognitively-optimized capture and retrieval system.

### The URI Anatomy

Every Obsidian URI follows this structure:

```
obsidian://[action]?[param1]=[value1]&[param2]=[value2]
```

| Component | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Protocol** | Always `obsidian://` | `obsidian://` |
| **Action** | The operation to perform | `open`, `new`, `search`, `daily` |
| **Parameters** | Key-value pairs controlling behavior | `vault=10_pur3v4d3r's-vault&file=note` |
| **Encoding** | Special characters must be URL-encoded | Space = `%20`, `/` = `%2F` |

> [!warning]
> **Critical Encoding Requirement**
> URI parameters **must be URL-encoded**. Special characters like spaces, slashes, and apostrophes will break the URI if not properly encoded. Your vault name `10_pur3v4d3r's-vault` would become `10_pur3v4d3r%27s-vault` in a URI. Online tools like urlencoder.org or PowerShell's `[System.Uri]::EscapeDataString()` handle this automatically.

### Why URIs Matter for Knowledge Work

The cognitive significance of URI-based automation lies in [[Cognitive Load Theory]]:

1. **Reduced Extraneous Load**: Every manual step (open Obsidian → navigate folder → create note → format metadata) consumes [[Working Memory]] capacity that should be reserved for thinking
2. **Increased Automaticity**: Repeated URI triggers become habitual, moving from conscious effort to automatic behavior
3. **Context Preservation**: Capture happens in-context without disrupting current mental state
4. **Environmental Triggering**: External cues (scheduled tasks, location-based automation) can prompt knowledge management behaviors

---

# 🔧 2. Native Obsidian URI Actions

## 2.1 The `open` Action

> [!definition]
> - **Key-Term**: `open` action
> - **Definition**: Opens a vault, or opens a specific file within a vault. The most fundamental URI action, serving as the foundation for navigation and retrieval workflows.

### Basic Syntax

```
obsidian://open?vault=[vault-name]&file=[file-path]
```

### Parameters Reference

| Parameter | Required | Description | Example |
|-----------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `vault` | Optional* | Vault name or vault ID | `vault=10_pur3v4d3r's-vault` |
| `file` | Optional | File path relative to vault root | `file=03_permanent-notes/metacognition` |
| `path` | Optional | Absolute system path (overrides vault+file) | `path=D:\10_pur3v4d3r's-vault\note.md` |

*If vault is omitted, Obsidian uses the most recently focused vault.

### Practical Examples

**Open your vault:**
```
obsidian://open?vault=10_pur3v4d3r's-vault
```

**Open a specific note:**
```
obsidian://open?vault=10_pur3v4d3r's-vault&file=05_moc-hubs/cognitive-science_moc
```

**Navigate to a heading within a note:**
```
obsidian://open?vault=10_pur3v4d3r's-vault&file=note-name#Heading%20Name
```

**Navigate to a block reference:**
```
obsidian://open?vault=10_pur3v4d3r's-vault&file=note-name#^block-id
```

> [!helpful-tip]
> **Shorthand Formats**
> Obsidian supports abbreviated URI formats for convenience:
> - `obsidian://vault/my-vault/my-note` → equivalent to `obsidian://open?vault=my-vault&file=my-note`
> - `obsidian:///D:/path/to/note.md` → opens using absolute path

---

## 2.2 The `new` Action

> [!definition]
> - **Key-Term**:: `new` action
> - **Definition**:: Creates a new note in the vault, optionally with specified content, name, and location. Essential for external capture workflows.

### Basic Syntax

```
obsidian://new?vault=[vault]&name=[note-name]&content=[note-content]
```

### Parameters Reference

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `vault` | Optional | Target vault |
| `name` | Optional | File name (without path—uses default location setting) |
| `file` | Optional | Full vault-relative path including name |
| `path` | Optional | Absolute system path |
| `content` | Optional | Note body content (URL-encoded) |
| `silent` | Optional | If `true`, don't open the note after creation |
| `append` | Optional | If `true`, append to existing file instead of failing |
| `overwrite` | Optional | If `true`, overwrite existing file |

### Practical Examples

**Create quick capture note:**
```
obsidian://new?vault=10_pur3v4d3r's-vault&name=quick-capture&content=Captured%20at%20%7B%7Btime%7D%7D
```

**Create note in specific folder:**
```
obsidian://new?vault=10_pur3v4d3r's-vault&file=00_inbox/new-idea&content=---frontmatter---
```

> [!methodology-and-sources]
> **Capture Workflow Pattern**
> 
> For [[Quick Capture]] workflows, the `new` action enables you to:
> 1. Create desktop shortcuts that instantly open capture forms
> 2. Build browser bookmarklets that save current page to inbox
> 3. Design [[Keyboard Maestro]] or [[AutoHotkey]] macros for system-wide capture
> 4. Schedule periodic review prompts via Windows Task Scheduler

---

## 2.3 The `search` Action

> [!definition]
> - **Key-Term**:: `search` action
> - **Definition**:: Opens the search pane and optionally executes a search query. Enables programmatic retrieval based on contextual needs.

### Basic Syntax

```
obsidian://search?vault=[vault]&query=[search-query]
```

### Practical Examples

**Search for a tag:**
```
obsidian://search?vault=10_pur3v4d3r's-vault&query=tag%3Acognitive-science
```

**Search for notes modified today:**
```
obsidian://search?vault=10_pur3v4d3r's-vault&query=file%3A("2025-11-25")
```

---

## 2.4 The `daily` Action

> [!definition]
> - **Key-Term**:: `daily` action
> - **Definition**:: Creates or opens today's daily note. Requires the Daily Notes core plugin to be enabled.

### Basic Syntax

```
obsidian://daily?vault=[vault]
```

> [!insight]
> **Cognitive Significance**
> The `daily` action is deceptively powerful. Daily notes serve as the **[[Working Memory]] interface** of your PKB—the temporal staging ground where raw cognition meets structured knowledge. A single-click desktop shortcut to `obsidian://daily` creates an environmental trigger that reinforces the habit of externalizing thought, aligning with [[03-notes/01_permanent-notes/01_cognitive-development/Spaced Repetition]] research showing that regular engagement intervals optimize retention.

---

## 2.5 The `hook-get-address` Action

> [!definition]
> - **Key-Term**:: `hook-get-address`
> - **Definition**:: Special action for integration with [[Hook]] (macOS linking utility). Returns a Markdown link to the currently focused note, enabling bidirectional linking between Obsidian and external files.

### Basic Syntax

```
obsidian://hook-get-address?vault=[vault]
```

This action supports [[X-Callback-URL]] parameters (`x-success`, `x-error`) for bidirectional communication with calling applications.

# ⚡ 3. Advanced URI Plugin - Extended Capabilities

> [!key-claim]
> **Game-Changing Extension**
> The [[Advanced URI]] plugin allows you to control many different features in Obsidian just by opening URIs. Because they are just text and don't require any mouse clicks or keyboard inputs, they are perfect to automate your Obsidian workflow. This community plugin dramatically expands what's possible with URI-based automation.

## 3.1 Installation & Configuration

1. Open Obsidian Settings → Community Plugins
2. Browse and search for "Advanced URI"
3. Install and enable
4. Configure default behaviors in plugin settings

## 3.2 Extended Action Categories

### Navigation Actions

The Advanced URI plugin provides navigation to workspaces, files, lines, headings, blocks, and settings tabs.

| Action | Parameters | Description |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Open workspace** | `workspace=name` | Loads saved workspace layout |
| **Open file at line** | `filepath=path&line=42` | Opens file scrolled to specific line |
| **Open heading** | `filepath=path&heading=Goal` | Navigates directly to heading |
| **Open block** | `filepath=path&block=12345` or just `block=12345` | Opens specific block (global search if no file specified) |
| **Open settings** | `settingid=plugin-id` | Opens specific settings tab |

**Example: Open your PKB dashboard workspace:**
```
obsidian://adv-uri?vault=10_pur3v4d3r's-vault&workspace=daily-review
```

### Writing Actions

The Advanced URI plugin supports write, overwrite, append, prepend, and new modes for content manipulation. The `data` parameter can be replaced with `clipboard=true` to get content from the clipboard.

| Mode | Parameters | Behavior |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Write** | `filepath=path&data=content` | Creates file only if not present |
| **Overwrite** | `filepath=path&data=content&mode=overwrite` | Replaces entire file content |
| **Append** | `filepath=path&data=content&mode=append` | Adds to end of file |
| **Prepend** | `filepath=path&data=content&mode=prepend` | Adds to beginning of file |
| **New (forced)** | `filepath=path&data=content&mode=new` | Creates file; adds number suffix if exists |

> [!use-cases-and-examples]
> **Real-World Application: Clipboard Capture**
>
> **Scenario**: You're reading a web article and want to save a quote to today's daily note without context-switching.
>
> **Solution**: Create a Windows shortcut that:
> 1. Copies selected text to clipboard (manual step)
> 2. Triggers: `obsidian://adv-uri?vault=10_pur3v4d3r's-vault&daily=true&clipboard=true&mode=append`
>
> **Result**: Quote appears in daily note with zero navigation friction.

### Command Execution

Advanced URI can execute any Obsidian command by ID. Using the command's ID is strongly recommended because it's not likely to change.

**Syntax:**
```
obsidian://adv-uri?vault=vault&commandid=command-id
```

**Find command IDs:**
- Open Command Palette (Ctrl+P)
- Use the Advanced URI helper command "Copy URI for command"
- Check plugin source code on GitHub

**Example: Export current note to PDF:**
```
obsidian://adv-uri?vault=10_pur3v4d3r's-vault&filepath=my-note&commandid=workspace:export-pdf
```

> [!helpful-tip]
> **Plugin Command Integration**
> Many plugins expose their functionality as commands. This means you can trigger [[Templater]] templates, [[quickadd]] macros, [[dataview]] refreshes, and more via URI. The `commandid` format is typically `plugin-id:command-name`.

### Frontmatter Manipulation

Advanced URI can read and edit [[YAML Frontmatter]] properties:

```
obsidian://adv-uri?vault=vault&filepath=note&frontmatterkey=status&data=completed
```

This enables programmatic metadata updates—crucial for [[GTD]]-style workflow states.

### Search and Replace

```
obsidian://adv-uri?vault=vault&filepath=note&search=old-text&replace=new-text
```

# 🔗 4. Actions URI Plugin - X-Callback Integration

> [!definition]
> - **Key-Term**:: [[Actions URI]]
> - **Definition**:: A community plugin that adds new [[X-Callback-URL]] endpoints to Obsidian so that external sources can better interact with an Obsidian instance. All new routes support `x-success` and `x-error` parameters as a way of communicating back to the sender.

## 4.1 X-Callback-URL Explained

The goal of the x-callback-url specification is to provide a standardized means for developers to expose and document methods they make available to other apps via custom URL schemes. Using x-callback-url, source apps can launch other apps passing data and context information, and also provide parameters instructing the target app to return data and control back to the source app after executing an action.

**Why This Matters:**
- **Bidirectional Communication**: Unlike simple URIs that are "fire and forget," x-callback-url enables responses
- **Error Handling**: `x-error` parameter catches failures gracefully
- **Chaining**: Build multi-step workflows where Obsidian returns control to the originating app

## 4.2 Actions URI Routes

The plugin adds endpoints like:
- `obsidian://actions-uri/note/create`
- `obsidian://actions-uri/note/append`
- `obsidian://actions-uri/daily-note/open`
- `obsidian://actions-uri/search/all`

Each route returns structured data via the callback URL, enabling sophisticated automation pipelines.

---

# 🖥️ 5. Windows Integration & PowerShell Automation

## 5.1 Launching URIs from PowerShell

You can use the PowerShell command `Start-Process` to launch an Obsidian URI.

**Basic Pattern:**
```powershell
Start-Process "obsidian://open?vault=10_pur3v4d3r's-vault&file=my-note"
```

**With Proper Encoding:**
```powershell
$vault = [System.Uri]::EscapeDataString("10_pur3v4d3r's-vault")
$file = [System.Uri]::EscapeDataString("03_permanent-notes/metacognition")
Start-Process "obsidian://open?vault=$vault&file=$file"
```

## 5.2 Windows Task Scheduler Integration

Windows Task Scheduler enables administrators to run PowerShell scripts automatically on a set schedule or in response to system events. This improves consistency, saves time, and reduces human error for tasks like backups, updates, monitoring, and cleanups.

> [!methodology-and-sources]
> **Scheduled Daily Review Workflow**
>
> **Goal**: Every morning at 8:00 AM, automatically open your daily note and weekly goals MOC.
>
> **Implementation Steps:**
>
> 1. **Create PowerShell Script** (`C:\Scripts\ObsidianMorningRoutine.ps1`):
> ```powershell
> # Open daily note
> Start-Process "obsidian://adv-uri?vault=10_pur3v4d3r's-vault&daily=true"
> Start-Sleep -Seconds 2
> # Open weekly goals in split pane
> Start-Process "obsidian://adv-uri?vault=10_pur3v4d3r's-vault&filepath=weekly-goals&openmode=split"
> ```
>
> 2. **Create Scheduled Task**:
>    - Open Task Scheduler (`taskschd.msc`)
>    - Create Task → Name: "PKB Morning Routine"
>    - Trigger: Daily at 8:00 AM
>    - Action: Start Program
>      - Program: `powershell.exe`
>      - Arguments: `-NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Scripts\ObsidianMorningRoutine.ps1"`
>
> 3. **Test**: Right-click task → Run

## 5.3 Desktop Shortcuts

Create `.url` shortcut files for one-click vault actions:

1. Right-click Desktop → New → Shortcut
2. Location: `obsidian://daily?vault=10_pur3v4d3r's-vault`
3. Name: "📝 Today's Note"

## 5.4 AutoHotkey Integration

For system-wide hotkeys that capture to Obsidian:

```autohotkey
; Ctrl+Shift+N - Quick capture to inbox
^+n::
    Run, obsidian://adv-uri?vault=10_pur3v4d3r's-vault&filepath=00_inbox/quick-capture&data=%clipboard%&mode=append
    return

; Ctrl+Shift+D - Open daily note from anywhere
^+d::
    Run, obsidian://daily?vault=10_pur3v4d3r's-vault
    return
```

# 🧠 6. Cognitive Science Applications

> [!the-philosophy]
> **Underlying Philosophy**
> 
> The true power of Obsidian URI isn't technical—it's **cognitive architectural**. Every URI-based workflow you implement is an investment in reducing the [[Extraneous Cognitive Load]] that separates you from actual thinking. The goal is to make your PKB an extension of your mind rather than a tool you have to consciously operate.

## 6.1 Aligning with Working Memory Constraints

> [!analogy]
> **The Cognitive Friction Problem**
>
> Imagine your [[Working Memory]] as a small desk with limited surface area (typically 4±1 items). Every time you need to capture a thought, you must:
> 
> 1. Clear mental space to remember the capture intention
> 2. Context-switch to Obsidian (losing current train of thought)
> 3. Navigate to correct location (consuming attention)
> 4. Format the note properly (executive function overhead)
> 5. Return to original task (re-loading mental context)
>
> **Each step occupies desk space.**
>
> URI automation collapses this to: **Hotkey → Done**. Your desk stays clear for actual cognition.

## 6.2 Leveraging Environmental Triggers

[[Behavioral Psychology]] research demonstrates that environmental cues are more effective than willpower for habit formation. URI-based automation creates these cues:

| Trigger Type | URI Implementation | Cognitive Benefit |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Temporal** | Scheduled daily note opening | Anchors reflection habit to time |
| **Contextual** | Browser extension captures current page | Captures in learning context |
| **Behavioral** | Desktop shortcut after shutdown | Links review to routine action |
| **Location** | Mobile automation at home arrival | Location-triggered inbox processing |

## 6.3 Supporting Spaced Repetition Workflows

The Spaced Repetition plugin helps you fight the forgetting curve by reviewing flashcards and entire notes. Notes due for review can be accessed directly from the status area.

**URI Integration Pattern:**

Create a scheduled task that opens your spaced repetition review queue:
```
obsidian://adv-uri?vault=10_pur3v4d3r's-vault&commandid=obsidian-spaced-repetition:review-flashcards
```

This removes the friction of remembering to review—the system prompts you.

## 6.4 Metacognitive Scaffolding

> [!thought-experiment]
> **Designing for Self-Regulated Learning**
>
> Imagine building a "Metacognitive Dashboard" that automatically appears during your scheduled learning sessions. Using URI + Task Scheduler:
>
> 1. **Forethought Phase** (session start): URI opens planning template with prompts
> 2. **Performance Phase** (during session): Hotkeys enable rapid atomic note capture
> 3. **Reflection Phase** (session end): Scheduled URI opens reflection template
>
> This externalizes the [[Self-Regulated Learning]] cycle, reducing the metacognitive burden of remembering to plan, monitor, and reflect.

## 6.5 Reducing Decision Fatigue

Every "where should I save this?" decision consumes [[Executive Function]] resources. URI automation with predefined destinations eliminates these micro-decisions:

| Content Type | Automated Destination |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Quick thoughts | `00_inbox/fleeting-notes` |
| Meeting notes | `02_projects/[current-project]` |
| Reading highlights | `04_reference-library/literature-notes` |
| Research findings | `daily-note (appended)` |

# 🔄 7. Integration Patterns with Existing Plugins

## 7.1 QuickAdd Integration

[[quickadd]] choices can be launched from external scripts or apps through the use of the `obsidian://quickadd` URI. All parameter names and values must be properly URL encoded to work.

**Syntax:**
```
obsidian://quickadd?choice=My%20Capture%20Choice&value-content=captured%20text
```

> [!use-cases-and-examples]
> **Browser Bookmarklet for QuickAdd**
>
> Create a browser bookmarklet that captures the current page to your PKB:
>
> ```javascript
> javascript:(function(){
>   var title = encodeURIComponent(document.title);
>   var url = encodeURIComponent(window.location.href);
>   window.location = 'obsidian://quickadd?choice=Web%20Capture&value-title=' + title + '&value-url=' + url;
> })();
> ```

## 7.2 Templater Integration

Trigger Templater templates via Advanced URI commands:

```
obsidian://adv-uri?vault=vault&commandid=templater-obsidian:create-new-note-from-template
```

Or use the Hotkeys for Templates plugin for direct template triggering.

## 7.3 Dataview Query Triggering

While Dataview queries run automatically, you can create URIs that open specific MOCs or dashboard notes containing Dataview views, effectively "running" your queries on demand.

## 7.4 Tasks Plugin Integration

Open your task management view:
```
obsidian://adv-uri?vault=vault&commandid=obsidian-tasks-plugin:edit-task
```

## 7.5 Shell Commands Plugin

The [[Shell Commands]] plugin lets you define shell/terminal commands and run them quickly via hotkeys or command palette. Advanced URI can insert clipboard content into a note: `start "" obsidian://advanced-uri?vault=Vault_name&filepath=Filename.md&data={{clipboard}}&mode=append` on Windows.

This creates a powerful feedback loop: Shell Commands triggers external scripts → scripts can call Obsidian URIs → results flow back to your vault.
