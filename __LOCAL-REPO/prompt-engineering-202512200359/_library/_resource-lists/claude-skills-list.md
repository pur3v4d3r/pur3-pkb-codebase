## What is a Claude skill
A Claude skill is a organized directory with `SKILL.md` along with instruction, code and resources that Claude can use to perform specific tasks. It works across Claude apps,API, Claude code. Refer to 
the official blog post in the [Official Resources](#official-resources) section for a comprehensive guide on how to build them.

## Why is it relevant
Skills allows you to perform specialized tasks using the tools and guidance that you needs. 
For e.g creating powerpoints following your organization's brand guidelines. 

Skills can also include code for Claude to execute as tools at its discretion. Claude can offload precise, deterministic operations—like parsing a PDF’s form fields, sorting large lists, or validating data—to code, then use its reasoning to orchestrate the workflow.
