# Subagents

> Create and use specialized AI subagents in Claude Code for task-specific workflows and improved context management.

Custom subagents in Claude Code are specialized AI assistants that can be invoked to handle specific types of tasks. They enable more efficient problem-solving by providing task-specific configurations with customized system prompts, tools and a separate context window.

## What are subagents?

Subagents are pre-configured AI personalities that Claude Code can delegate tasks to. Each subagent:

* Has a specific purpose and expertise area
* Uses its own context window separate from the main conversation
* Can be configured with specific tools it's allowed to use
* Includes a custom system prompt that guides its behavior

When Claude Code encounters a task that matches a subagent's expertise, it can delegate that task to the specialized subagent, which works independently and returns results.

## Quick start

To create your first subagent:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the subagents interface">
    Run the following command:

    ```
    /agents
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select 'Create New Agent'">
    Choose whether to create a project-level or user-level subagent
  </Step>

  <Step title="Define the subagent">
    * **Recommended**: generate with Claude first, then customize to make it yours
    * Describe your subagent in detail, including when Claude should use it
    * Select the tools you want to grant access to, or leave this blank to inherit all tools
    * The interface shows all available tools
    * If you're generating with Claude, you can also edit the system prompt in your own editor by pressing `e`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save and use">
    Your subagent is now available. Claude uses it automatically when appropriate, or you can invoke it explicitly:

    ```
    > Use the code-reviewer subagent to check my recent changes
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Subagent configuration

### File locations

Subagents are stored as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter in two possible locations:

| Type                  | Location            | Scope                         | Priority |
| :-------------------- | :------------------ | :---------------------------- | :------- |
| **Project subagents** | `.claude/agents/`   | Available in current project  | Highest  |
| **User subagents**    | `~/.claude/agents/` | Available across all projects | Lower    |

When subagent names conflict, project-level subagents take precedence over user-level subagents.

### Plugin agents

[Plugins](/en/plugins) can provide custom subagents that integrate seamlessly with Claude Code. Plugin agents work identically to user-defined agents and appear in the `/agents` interface.

**Plugin agent locations**: plugins include agents in their `agents/` directory (or custom paths specified in the plugin manifest).

**Using plugin agents**:

* Plugin agents appear in `/agents` alongside your custom agents
* Can be invoked explicitly: "Use the code-reviewer agent from the security-plugin"
* Can be invoked automatically by Claude when appropriate
* Can be managed (viewed, inspected) through `/agents` interface

See the [plugin components reference](/en/plugins-reference#agents) for details on creating plugin agents.

### CLI-based configuration

You can also define subagents dynamically using the `--agents` CLI flag, which accepts a JSON object:

```bash  theme={null}
claude --agents '{
  "code-reviewer": {
    "description": "Expert code reviewer. Use proactively after code changes.",
    "prompt": "You are a senior code reviewer. Focus on code quality, security, and best practices.",
    "tools": ["Read", "Grep", "Glob", "Bash"],
    "model": "sonnet"
  }
}'
```

**Priority**: CLI-defined subagents have lower priority than project-level subagents but higher priority than user-level subagents.

**Use case**: This approach is useful for:

* Quick testing of subagent configurations
* Session-specific subagents that don't need to be saved
* Automation scripts that need custom subagents
* Sharing subagent definitions in documentation or scripts

For detailed information about the JSON format and all available options, see the [CLI reference documentation](/en/cli-reference#agents-flag-format).

### File format

Each subagent is defined in a Markdown file with this structure:

```markdown  theme={null}
---
name: your-sub-agent-name
description: Description of when this subagent should be invoked
tools: tool1, tool2, tool3  # Optional - inherits all tools if omitted
model: sonnet  # Optional - specify model alias or 'inherit'
permissionMode: default  # Optional - permission mode for the subagent
skills: skill1, skill2  # Optional - skills to auto-load
---

Your subagent's system prompt goes here. This can be multiple paragraphs
and should clearly define the subagent's role, capabilities, and approach
to solving problems.

Include specific instructions, best practices, and any constraints
the subagent should follow.
```

#### Configuration fields

| Field            | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :--------------- | :------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`           | Yes      | Unique identifier using lowercase letters and hyphens                                                                                                                                                           |
| `description`    | Yes      | Natural language description of the subagent's purpose                                                                                                                                                          |
| `tools`          | No       | Comma-separated list of specific tools. If omitted, inherits all tools from the main thread                                                                                                                     |
| `model`          | No       | Model to use for this subagent. Can be a model alias (`sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`) or `'inherit'` to use the main conversation's model. If omitted, defaults to the [configured subagent model](/en/model-config) |
| `permissionMode` | No       | Permission mode for the subagent. Valid values: `default`, `acceptEdits`, `bypassPermissions`, `plan`, `ignore`. Controls how the subagent handles permission requests                                          |
| `skills`         | No       | Comma-separated list of skill names to auto-load when the subagent starts. Skills are loaded into the subagent's context automatically                                                                          |

### Model selection

The `model` field allows you to control which [AI model](/en/model-config) the subagent uses:

* **Model alias**: Use one of the available aliases: `sonnet`, `opus`, or `haiku`
* **`'inherit'`**: Use the same model as the main conversation (useful for consistency)
* **Omitted**: If not specified, uses the default model configured for subagents (`sonnet`)

<Note>
  Using `'inherit'` is particularly useful when you want your subagents to adapt to the model choice of the main conversation, ensuring consistent capabilities and response style throughout your session.
</Note>

### Available tools

Subagents can be granted access to any of Claude Code's internal tools. See the [tools documentation](/en/settings#tools-available-to-claude) for a complete list of available tools.

<Tip>
  **Recommended:** Use the `/agents` command to modify tool access - it provides an interactive interface that lists all available tools, including any connected MCP server tools, making it easier to select the ones you need.
</Tip>

You have two options for configuring tools:

* **Omit the `tools` field** to inherit all tools from the main thread (default), including MCP tools
* **Specify individual tools** as a comma-separated list for more granular control (can be edited manually or via `/agents`)

**MCP Tools**: Subagents can access MCP tools from configured MCP servers. When the `tools` field is omitted, subagents inherit all MCP tools available to the main thread.

## Managing subagents

### Using the /agents command (Recommended)

The `/agents` command provides a comprehensive interface for subagent management:

```
/agents
```

This opens an interactive menu where you can:

* View all available subagents (built-in, user, and project)
* Create new subagents with guided setup
* Edit existing custom subagents, including their tool access
* Delete custom subagents
* See which subagents are active when duplicates exist
* **Manage tool permissions** with a complete list of available tools

### Direct file management

You can also manage subagents by working directly with their files:

```bash  theme={null}
# Create a project subagent
mkdir -p .claude/agents
echo '---
name: test-runner
description: Use proactively to run tests and fix failures
---

You are a test automation expert. When you see code changes, proactively run the appropriate tests. If tests fail, analyze the failures and fix them while preserving the original test intent.' > .claude/agents/test-runner.md

# Create a user subagent
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents
# ... create subagent file
```

<Note>
  Subagents created by manually adding files will be loaded the next time you start a Claude Code session. To create and use a subagent immediately without restarting, use the `/agents` command instead.
</Note>

## Using subagents effectively

### Automatic delegation

Claude Code proactively delegates tasks based on:

* The task description in your request
* The `description` field in subagent configurations
* Current context and available tools

<Tip>
  To encourage more proactive subagent use, include phrases like "use PROACTIVELY" or "MUST BE USED" in your `description` field.
</Tip>

### Explicit invocation

Request a specific subagent by mentioning it in your command:

```
> Use the test-runner subagent to fix failing tests
> Have the code-reviewer subagent look at my recent changes
> Ask the debugger subagent to investigate this error
```

## Built-in subagents

Claude Code includes built-in subagents that are available out of the box:

### General-purpose subagent

The general-purpose subagent is a capable agent for complex, multi-step tasks that require both exploration and action. Unlike the Explore subagent, it can modify files and execute a wider range of operations.

**Key characteristics:**

* **Model**: Uses Sonnet for more capable reasoning
* **Tools**: Has access to all tools
* **Mode**: Can read and write files, execute commands, make changes
* **Purpose**: Complex research tasks, multi-step operations, code modifications

**When Claude uses it:**

Claude delegates to the general-purpose subagent when:

* The task requires both exploration and modification
* Complex reasoning is needed to interpret search results
* Multiple strategies may be needed if initial searches fail
* The task has multiple steps that depend on each other

**Example scenario:**

```
User: Find all the places where we handle authentication and update them to use the new token format

Claude: [Invokes general-purpose subagent]
[Agent searches for auth-related code across codebase]
[Agent reads and analyzes multiple files]
[Agent makes necessary edits]
[Returns detailed writeup of changes made]
```

### Plan subagent

The Plan subagent is a specialized built-in agent designed for use during plan mode. When Claude is operating in plan mode (non-execution mode), it uses the Plan subagent to conduct research and gather information about your codebase before presenting a plan.

**Key characteristics:**

* **Model**: Uses Sonnet for more capable analysis
* **Tools**: Has access to Read, Glob, Grep, and Bash tools for codebase exploration
* **Purpose**: Searches files, analyzes code structure, and gathers context
* **Automatic invocation**: Claude automatically uses this agent when in plan mode and needs to research the codebase

**How it works:**
When you're in plan mode and Claude needs to understand your codebase to create a plan, it delegates research tasks to the Plan subagent. This prevents infinite nesting of agents (subagents cannot spawn other subagents) while still allowing Claude to gather the necessary context.

**Example scenario:**

```
User: [In plan mode] Help me refactor the authentication module

Claude: Let me research your authentication implementation first...
[Internally invokes Plan subagent to explore auth-related files]
[Plan subagent searches codebase and returns findings]
Claude: Based on my research, here's my proposed plan...
```

<Tip>
  The Plan subagent is only used in plan mode. In normal execution mode, Claude uses the general-purpose agent or other custom subagents you've created.
</Tip>

### Explore subagent

The Explore subagent is a fast, lightweight agent optimized for searching and analyzing codebases. It operates in strict read-only mode and is designed for rapid file discovery and code exploration.

**Key characteristics:**

* **Model**: Uses Haiku for fast, low-latency searches
* **Mode**: Strictly read-only - cannot create, modify, or delete files
* **Tools available**:
  * Glob - File pattern matching
  * Grep - Content searching with regular expressions
  * Read - Reading file contents
  * Bash - Read-only commands only (ls, git status, git log, git diff, find, cat, head, tail)

**When Claude uses it:**

Claude will delegate to the Explore subagent when it needs to search or understand a codebase but doesn't need to make changes. This is more efficient than the main agent running multiple search commands directly, as content found during the exploration process doesn't bloat the main conversation.

**Thoroughness levels:**

When invoking the Explore subagent, Claude specifies a thoroughness level:

* **Quick** - Fast searches with minimal exploration. Good for targeted lookups.
* **Medium** - Moderate exploration. Balances speed and thoroughness.
* **Very thorough** - Comprehensive analysis across multiple locations and naming conventions. Used when the target might be in unexpected places.

**Example scenarios:**

```
User: Where are errors from the client handled?

Claude: [Invokes Explore subagent with "medium" thoroughness]
[Explore uses Grep to search for error handling patterns]
[Explore uses Read to examine promising files]
[Returns findings with absolute file paths]
Claude: Client errors are handled in src/services/process.ts:712...
```

```
User: What's the codebase structure?

Claude: [Invokes Explore subagent with "quick" thoroughness]
[Explore uses Glob and ls to map directory structure]
[Returns overview of key directories and their purposes]
```

## Example subagents

### Code reviewer

```markdown  theme={null}
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Expert code review specialist. Proactively reviews code for quality, security, and maintainability. Use immediately after writing or modifying code.
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
model: inherit
---

You are a senior code reviewer ensuring high standards of code quality and security.

When invoked:
1. Run git diff to see recent changes
2. Focus on modified files
3. Begin review immediately

Review checklist:
- Code is clear and readable
- Functions and variables are well-named
- No duplicated code
- Proper error handling
- No exposed secrets or API keys
- Input validation implemented
- Good test coverage
- Performance considerations addressed

Provide feedback organized by priority:
- Critical issues (must fix)
- Warnings (should fix)
- Suggestions (consider improving)

Include specific examples of how to fix issues.
```

### Debugger

```markdown  theme={null}
---
name: debugger
description: Debugging specialist for errors, test failures, and unexpected behavior. Use proactively when encountering any issues.
tools: Read, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob
---

You are an expert debugger specializing in root cause analysis.

When invoked:
1. Capture error message and stack trace
2. Identify reproduction steps
3. Isolate the failure location
4. Implement minimal fix
5. Verify solution works

Debugging process:
- Analyze error messages and logs
- Check recent code changes
- Form and test hypotheses
- Add strategic debug logging
- Inspect variable states

For each issue, provide:
- Root cause explanation
- Evidence supporting the diagnosis
- Specific code fix
- Testing approach
- Prevention recommendations

Focus on fixing the underlying issue, not the symptoms.
```

### Data scientist

```markdown  theme={null}
---
name: data-scientist
description: Data analysis expert for SQL queries, BigQuery operations, and data insights. Use proactively for data analysis tasks and queries.
tools: Bash, Read, Write
model: sonnet
---

You are a data scientist specializing in SQL and BigQuery analysis.

When invoked:
1. Understand the data analysis requirement
2. Write efficient SQL queries
3. Use BigQuery command line tools (bq) when appropriate
4. Analyze and summarize results
5. Present findings clearly

Key practices:
- Write optimized SQL queries with proper filters
- Use appropriate aggregations and joins
- Include comments explaining complex logic
- Format results for readability
- Provide data-driven recommendations

For each analysis:
- Explain the query approach
- Document any assumptions
- Highlight key findings
- Suggest next steps based on data

Always ensure queries are efficient and cost-effective.
```

## Best practices

* **Start with Claude-generated agents**: We highly recommend generating your initial subagent with Claude and then iterating on it to make it personally yours. This approach gives you the best results - a solid foundation that you can customize to your specific needs.

* **Design focused subagents**: Create subagents with single, clear responsibilities rather than trying to make one subagent do everything. This improves performance and makes subagents more predictable.

* **Write detailed prompts**: Include specific instructions, examples, and constraints in your system prompts. The more guidance you provide, the better the subagent will perform.

* **Limit tool access**: Only grant tools that are necessary for the subagent's purpose. This improves security and helps the subagent focus on relevant actions.

* **Version control**: Check project subagents into version control so your team can benefit from and improve them collaboratively.

## Advanced usage

### Chaining subagents

For complex workflows, you can chain multiple subagents:

```
> First use the code-analyzer subagent to find performance issues, then use the optimizer subagent to fix them
```

### Dynamic subagent selection

Claude Code intelligently selects subagents based on context. Make your `description` fields specific and action-oriented for best results.

### Resumable subagents

Subagents can be resumed to continue previous conversations, which is particularly useful for long-running research or analysis tasks that need to be continued across multiple invocations.

**How it works:**

* Each subagent execution is assigned a unique `agentId`
* The agent's conversation is stored in a separate transcript file: `agent-{agentId}.jsonl`
* You can resume a previous agent by providing its `agentId` via the `resume` parameter
* When resumed, the agent continues with full context from its previous conversation

**Example workflow:**

Initial invocation:

```
> Use the code-analyzer agent to start reviewing the authentication module

[Agent completes initial analysis and returns agentId: "abc123"]
```

Resume the agent:

```
> Resume agent abc123 and now analyze the authorization logic as well

[Agent continues with full context from previous conversation]
```

**Use cases:**

* **Long-running research**: Break down large codebase analysis into multiple sessions
* **Iterative refinement**: Continue refining a subagent's work without losing context
* **Multi-step workflows**: Have a subagent work on related tasks sequentially while maintaining context

**Technical details:**

* Agent transcripts are stored in your project directory
* Recording is disabled during resume to avoid duplicating messages
* Both synchronous and asynchronous agents can be resumed
* The `resume` parameter accepts the agent ID from a previous execution

**Programmatic usage:**

If you're using the Agent SDK or interacting with the AgentTool directly, you can pass the `resume` parameter:

```typescript  theme={null}
{
  "description": "Continue analysis",
  "prompt": "Now examine the error handling patterns",
  "subagent_type": "code-analyzer",
  "resume": "abc123"  // Agent ID from previous execution
}
```

<Tip>
  Keep track of agent IDs for tasks you may want to resume later. Claude Code displays the agent ID when a subagent completes its work.
</Tip>

## Performance considerations

* **Context efficiency**: Agents help preserve main context, enabling longer overall sessions
* **Latency**: Subagents start off with a clean slate each time they are invoked and may add latency as they gather context that they require to do their job effectively.

# Create plugins

> Create custom plugins to extend Claude Code with slash commands, agents, hooks, Skills, and MCP servers.

Plugins let you extend Claude Code with custom functionality that can be shared across projects and teams. This guide covers creating your own plugins with slash commands, agents, Skills, hooks, and MCP servers.

Looking to install existing plugins? See [Discover and install plugins](/en/discover-plugins). For complete technical specifications, see [Plugins reference](/en/plugins-reference).

## When to use plugins vs standalone configuration

Claude Code supports two ways to add custom slash commands, agents, and hooks:

| Approach                                                    | Slash command names  | Best for                                                                                        |
| :---------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Standalone** (`.claude/` directory)                       | `/hello`             | Personal workflows, project-specific customizations, quick experiments                          |
| **Plugins** (directories with `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`) | `/plugin-name:hello` | Sharing with teammates, distributing to community, versioned releases, reusable across projects |

**Use standalone configuration when**:

* You're customizing Claude Code for a single project
* The configuration is personal and doesn't need to be shared
* You're experimenting with slash commands or hooks before packaging them
* You want short slash command names like `/hello` or `/review`

**Use plugins when**:

* You want to share functionality with your team or community
* You need the same slash commands/agents across multiple projects
* You want version control and easy updates for your extensions
* You're distributing through a marketplace
* You're okay with namespaced slash commands like `/my-plugin:hello` (namespacing prevents conflicts between plugins)

<Tip>
  Start with standalone configuration in `.claude/` for quick iteration, then [convert to a plugin](#convert-existing-configurations-to-plugins) when you're ready to share.
</Tip>

## Quickstart

This quickstart walks you through creating a plugin with a custom slash command. You'll create a manifest (the configuration file that defines your plugin), add a slash command, and test it locally using the `--plugin-dir` flag.

### Prerequisites

* Claude Code [installed and authenticated](/en/quickstart#step-1-install-claude-code)
* Claude Code version 1.0.33 or later (run `claude --version` to check)

<Note>
  If you don't see the `/plugin` command, update Claude Code to the latest version. See [Troubleshooting](/en/troubleshooting) for upgrade instructions.
</Note>

### Create your first plugin

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create the plugin directory">
    Every plugin lives in its own directory containing a manifest and your custom commands, agents, or hooks. Create one now:

    ```bash  theme={null}
    mkdir my-first-plugin
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create the plugin manifest">
    The manifest file at `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` defines your plugin's identity: its name, description, and version. Claude Code uses this metadata to display your plugin in the plugin manager.

    Create the `.claude-plugin` directory inside your plugin folder:

    ```bash  theme={null}
    mkdir my-first-plugin/.claude-plugin
    ```

    Then create `my-first-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` with this content:

    ```json my-first-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json theme={null}
    {
    "name": "my-first-plugin",
    "description": "A greeting plugin to learn the basics",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "author": {
    "name": "Your Name"
    }
    }
    ```

    | Field         | Purpose                                                                                                                |
    | :------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `name`        | Unique identifier and slash command namespace. Slash commands are prefixed with this (e.g., `/my-first-plugin:hello`). |
    | `description` | Shown in the plugin manager when browsing or installing plugins.                                                       |
    | `version`     | Track releases using [semantic versioning](/en/plugins-reference#version-management).                                  |
    | `author`      | Optional. Helpful for attribution.                                                                                     |

    For additional fields like `homepage`, `repository`, and `license`, see the [full manifest schema](/en/plugins-reference#plugin-manifest-schema).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a slash command">
    Slash commands are Markdown files in the `commands/` directory. The filename becomes the slash command name, prefixed with the plugin's namespace (`hello.md` in a plugin named `my-first-plugin` creates `/my-first-plugin:hello`). The Markdown content tells Claude how to respond when someone runs the slash command.

    Create a `commands` directory in your plugin folder:

    ```bash  theme={null}
    mkdir my-first-plugin/commands
    ```

    Then create `my-first-plugin/commands/hello.md` with this content:

    ```markdown my-first-plugin/commands/hello.md theme={null}
    ---
    description: Greet the user with a friendly message
    ---

    # Hello Command

    Greet the user warmly and ask how you can help them today.
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test your plugin">
    Run Claude Code with the `--plugin-dir` flag to load your plugin:

    ```bash  theme={null}
    claude --plugin-dir ./my-first-plugin
    ```

    Once Claude Code starts, try your new command:

    ```shell  theme={null}
    /my-first-plugin:hello
    ```

    You'll see Claude respond with a greeting. Run `/help` to see your command listed under the plugin namespace.

    <Note>
      **Why namespacing?** Plugin slash commands are always namespaced (like `/greet:hello`) to prevent conflicts when multiple plugins have commands with the same name.

      To change the namespace prefix, update the `name` field in `plugin.json`.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add slash command arguments">
    Make your slash command dynamic by accepting user input. The `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder captures any text the user provides after the slash command.

    Update your `hello.md` file:

    ```markdown my-first-plugin/commands/hello.md theme={null}
    ---
    description: Greet the user with a personalized message
    ---

    # Hello Command

    Greet the user named "$ARGUMENTS" warmly and ask how you can help them today. Make the greeting personal and encouraging.
    ```

    Restart Claude Code to pick up the changes, then try the command with your name:

    ```shell  theme={null}
    /my-first-plugin:hello Alex
    ```

    Claude will greet you by name. For more argument options like `$1`, `$2` for individual parameters, see [Slash commands](/en/slash-commands).
  </Step>
</Steps>

You've successfully created and tested a plugin with these key components:

* **Plugin manifest** (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`): describes your plugin's metadata
* **Commands directory** (`commands/`): contains your custom slash commands
* **Command arguments** (`$ARGUMENTS`): captures user input for dynamic behavior

<Tip>
  The `--plugin-dir` flag is useful for development and testing. When you're ready to share your plugin with others, see [Create and distribute a plugin marketplace](/en/plugin-marketplaces).
</Tip>

## Plugin structure overview

You've created a plugin with a slash command, but plugins can include much more: custom agents, Skills, hooks, MCP servers, and LSP servers.

<Warning>
  **Common mistake**: Don't put `commands/`, `agents/`, `skills/`, or `hooks/` inside the `.claude-plugin/` directory. Only `plugin.json` goes inside `.claude-plugin/`. All other directories must be at the plugin root level.
</Warning>

| Directory         | Location    | Purpose                                         |
| :---------------- | :---------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| `.claude-plugin/` | Plugin root | Contains only `plugin.json` manifest (required) |
| `commands/`       | Plugin root | Slash commands as Markdown files                |
| `agents/`         | Plugin root | Custom agent definitions                        |
| `skills/`         | Plugin root | Agent Skills with `SKILL.md` files              |
| `hooks/`          | Plugin root | Event handlers in `hooks.json`                  |
| `.mcp.json`       | Plugin root | MCP server configurations                       |
| `.lsp.json`       | Plugin root | LSP server configurations for code intelligence |

<Note>
  **Next steps**: Ready to add more features? Jump to [Develop more complex plugins](#develop-more-complex-plugins) to add agents, hooks, MCP servers, and LSP servers. For complete technical specifications of all plugin components, see [Plugins reference](/en/plugins-reference).
</Note>

## Develop more complex plugins

Once you're comfortable with basic plugins, you can create more sophisticated extensions.

### Add Skills to your plugin

Plugins can include [Agent Skills](/en/skills) to extend Claude's capabilities. Skills are model-invoked; Claude autonomously uses them based on the task context.

To add Skills to your plugin, create a `skills/` directory at your plugin root and add Skill folders with `SKILL.md` files. Plugin Skills are automatically available when the plugin is installed.

For complete Skill authoring guidance, see [Agent Skills](/en/skills).

### Add LSP servers to your plugin

<Tip>
  For common languages like TypeScript, Python, and Rust, install the pre-built LSP plugins from the official marketplace. Create custom LSP plugins only when you need support for languages not already covered.
</Tip>

LSP (Language Server Protocol) plugins give Claude real-time code intelligence. If you need to support a language that doesn't have an official LSP plugin, you can create your own by adding an `.lsp.json` file to your plugin:

```json .lsp.json theme={null}
{
  "go": {
    "command": "gopls",
    "args": ["serve"],
    "extensionToLanguage": {
      ".go": "go"
    }
  }
}
```

Users installing your plugin must have the language server binary installed on their machine.

For complete LSP configuration options, see [LSP servers](/en/plugins-reference#lsp-servers).

### Organize complex plugins

For plugins with many components, organize your directory structure by functionality. For complete directory layouts and organization patterns, see [Plugin directory structure](/en/plugins-reference#plugin-directory-structure).

### Test your plugins locally

Use the `--plugin-dir` flag to test plugins during development. This loads your plugin directly without requiring installation.

```bash  theme={null}
claude --plugin-dir ./my-plugin
```

As you make changes to your plugin, restart Claude Code to pick up the updates. Test your plugin components:

* Try your commands with `/command-name`
* Check that agents appear in `/agents`
* Verify hooks work as expected

<Tip>
  You can load multiple plugins at once by specifying the flag multiple times:

  ```bash  theme={null}
  claude --plugin-dir ./plugin-one --plugin-dir ./plugin-two
  ```
</Tip>

### Debug plugin issues

If your plugin isn't working as expected:

1. **Check the structure**: Ensure your directories are at the plugin root, not inside `.claude-plugin/`
2. **Test components individually**: Check each command, agent, and hook separately
3. **Use validation and debugging tools**: See [Debugging and development tools](/en/plugins-reference#debugging-and-development-tools) for CLI commands and troubleshooting techniques

### Share your plugins

When your plugin is ready to share:

1. **Add documentation**: Include a `README.md` with installation and usage instructions
2. **Version your plugin**: Use [semantic versioning](/en/plugins-reference#version-management) in your `plugin.json`
3. **Create or use a marketplace**: Distribute through [plugin marketplaces](/en/plugin-marketplaces) for installation
4. **Test with others**: Have team members test the plugin before wider distribution

Once your plugin is in a marketplace, others can install it using the instructions in [Discover and install plugins](/en/discover-plugins).

<Note>
  For complete technical specifications, debugging techniques, and distribution strategies, see [Plugins reference](/en/plugins-reference).
</Note>

## Convert existing configurations to plugins

If you already have custom commands, Skills, or hooks in your `.claude/` directory, you can convert them into a plugin for easier sharing and distribution.

### Migration steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create the plugin structure">
    Create a new plugin directory:

    ```bash  theme={null}
    mkdir -p my-plugin/.claude-plugin
    ```

    Create the manifest file at `my-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`:

    ```json my-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json theme={null}
    {
      "name": "my-plugin",
      "description": "Migrated from standalone configuration",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy your existing files">
    Copy your existing configurations to the plugin directory:

    ```bash  theme={null}
    # Copy commands
    cp -r .claude/commands my-plugin/

    # Copy agents (if any)
    cp -r .claude/agents my-plugin/

    # Copy skills (if any)
    cp -r .claude/skills my-plugin/
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Migrate hooks">
    If you have hooks in your settings, create a hooks directory:

    ```bash  theme={null}
    mkdir my-plugin/hooks
    ```

    Create `my-plugin/hooks/hooks.json` with your hooks configuration. Copy the `hooks` object from your `.claude/settings.json` or `settings.local.json`—the format is the same:

    ```json my-plugin/hooks/hooks.json theme={null}
    {
      "hooks": {
        "PostToolUse": [
          {
            "matcher": "Write|Edit",
            "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "npm run lint:fix $FILE" }]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test your migrated plugin">
    Load your plugin to verify everything works:

    ```bash  theme={null}
    claude --plugin-dir ./my-plugin
    ```

    Test each component: run your commands, check agents appear in `/agents`, and verify hooks trigger correctly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### What changes when migrating

| Standalone (`.claude/`)       | Plugin                           |
| :---------------------------- | :------------------------------- |
| Only available in one project | Can be shared via marketplaces   |
| Files in `.claude/commands/`  | Files in `plugin-name/commands/` |
| Hooks in `settings.json`      | Hooks in `hooks/hooks.json`      |
| Must manually copy to share   | Install with `/plugin install`   |

<Note>
  After migrating, you can remove the original files from `.claude/` to avoid duplicates. The plugin version will take precedence when loaded.
</Note>

## Next steps

# Discover and install prebuilt plugins through marketplaces

> Find and install plugins from marketplaces to extend Claude Code with new commands, agents, and capabilities.

Plugins extend Claude Code with custom commands, agents, hooks, and MCP servers. Plugin marketplaces are catalogs that help you discover and install these extensions without building them yourself.

Looking to create and distribute your own marketplace? See [Create and distribute a plugin marketplace](/en/plugin-marketplaces).

## How marketplaces work

A marketplace is a catalog of plugins that someone else has created and shared. Using a marketplace is a two-step process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add the marketplace">
    This registers the catalog with Claude Code so you can browse what's available. No plugins are installed yet.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install individual plugins">
    Browse the catalog and install the plugins you want.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Think of it like adding an app store: adding the store gives you access to browse its collection, but you still choose which apps to download individually.

## Official Anthropic marketplace

The official Anthropic marketplace (`claude-plugins-official`) is automatically installed when you start Claude Code. You can browse its plugins immediately by running `/plugin` and going to the **Discover** tab.

To install a plugin from the official marketplace:

```shell  theme={null}
/plugin install plugin-name@claude-plugins-official
```

## Try it: add the demo marketplace

Anthropic also maintains a [demo plugins marketplace](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/plugins) with example plugins that show what's possible with the plugin system. Unlike the official marketplace, you need to add this one manually.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add the marketplace">
    From within Claude Code, run the `plugin marketplace add` command for the `anthropics/claude-code` marketplace:

    ```shell  theme={null}
    /plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-code
    ```

    This downloads the marketplace catalog and makes its plugins available to you.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Browse available plugins">
    Run `/plugin` to open the plugin manager. This opens a tabbed interface with four tabs you can cycle through using **Tab** (or **Shift+Tab** to go backward):

    * **Discover**: browse available plugins from all your marketplaces
    * **Installed**: view and manage your installed plugins
    * **Marketplaces**: add, remove, or update your added marketplaces
    * **Errors**: view any plugin loading errors

    Go to the **Discover** tab to see plugins from the marketplace you just added.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install a plugin">
    Select a plugin to view its details, then choose an installation scope:

    * **User scope**: install for yourself across all projects
    * **Project scope**: install for all collaborators on this repository
    * **Local scope**: install for yourself in this repository only

    For example, select **commit-commands** (a plugin that adds git workflow commands) and install it to your user scope.

    You can also install directly from the command line:

    ```shell  theme={null}
    /plugin install commit-commands@anthropics-claude-code
    ```

    See [Configuration scopes](/en/settings#configuration-scopes) to learn more about scopes.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use your new plugin">
    After installing, the plugin's commands are immediately available. Plugin commands are namespaced by the plugin name, so **commit-commands** provides commands like `/commit-commands:commit`.

    Try it out by making a change to a file and running:

    ```shell  theme={null}
    /commit-commands:commit
    ```

    This stages your changes, generates a commit message, and creates the commit.

    Each plugin works differently. Check the plugin's description in the **Discover** tab or its homepage to learn what commands and capabilities it provides.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The rest of this guide covers all the ways you can add marketplaces, install plugins, and manage your configuration.

## Add marketplaces

Use the `/plugin marketplace add` command to add marketplaces from different sources.

<Tip>
  **Shortcuts**: You can use `/plugin market` instead of `/plugin marketplace`, and `rm` instead of `remove`.
</Tip>

* **GitHub repositories**: `owner/repo` format (for example, `anthropics/claude-code`)
* **Git URLs**: any git repository URL (GitLab, Bitbucket, self-hosted)
* **Local paths**: directories or direct paths to `marketplace.json` files
* **Remote URLs**: direct URLs to hosted `marketplace.json` files

### Add from GitHub

Add a GitHub repository that contains a `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` file using the `owner/repo` format—where `owner` is the GitHub username or organization and `repo` is the repository name.

For example, `anthropics/claude-code` refers to the `claude-code` repository owned by `anthropics`:

```shell  theme={null}
/plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-code
```

### Add from other Git hosts

Add any git repository by providing the full URL. This works with any Git host, including GitLab, Bitbucket, and self-hosted servers:

Using HTTPS:

```shell  theme={null}
/plugin marketplace add https://gitlab.com/company/plugins.git
```

Using SSH:

```shell  theme={null}
/plugin marketplace add git@gitlab.com:company/plugins.git
```

To add a specific branch or tag, append `#` followed by the ref:

```shell  theme={null}
/plugin marketplace add https://gitlab.com/company/plugins.git#v1.0.0
```

### Add from local paths

Add a local directory that contains a `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` file:

```shell  theme={null}
/plugin marketplace add ./my-marketplace
```

You can also add a direct path to a `marketplace.json` file:

```shell  theme={null}
/plugin marketplace add ./path/to/marketplace.json
```

Or add a remote `marketplace.json` file via URL:

```shell  theme={null}
/plugin marketplace add https://example.com/marketplace.json
```

## Install plugins

Once you've added marketplaces, you can install plugins directly (installs to user scope by default):

```shell  theme={null}
/plugin install plugin-name@marketplace-name
```

To choose a different [installation scope](/en/settings#configuration-scopes), use the interactive UI: run `/plugin`, go to the **Discover** tab, and press **Enter** on a plugin. You'll see options for:

* **User scope** (default): install for yourself across all projects
* **Project scope**: install for all collaborators on this repository (adds to `.claude/settings.json`)
* **Local scope**: install for yourself in this repository only (not shared with collaborators)

You may also see plugins with **managed** scope—these are installed by enterprise administrators via [managed settings](/en/settings#enterprise-managed-policy-settings) and cannot be modified.

Run `/plugin` and go to the **Installed** tab to see your plugins grouped by scope.

<Warning>
  Make sure you trust a plugin before installing it. Anthropic does not control what MCP servers, files, or other software are included in plugins and cannot verify that they work as intended. Check each plugin's homepage for more information.
</Warning>

## Manage installed plugins

Run `/plugin` and go to the **Installed** tab to view, enable, disable, or uninstall your plugins.

You can also manage plugins with direct commands.

Disable a plugin without uninstalling:

```shell  theme={null}
/plugin disable plugin-name@marketplace-name
```

Re-enable a disabled plugin:

```shell  theme={null}
/plugin enable plugin-name@marketplace-name
```

Completely remove a plugin:

```shell  theme={null}
/plugin uninstall plugin-name@marketplace-name
```

The `--scope` option lets you target a specific scope with CLI commands:

```shell  theme={null}
claude plugin install formatter@your-org --scope project
claude plugin uninstall formatter@your-org --scope project
```

## Manage marketplaces

You can manage marketplaces through the interactive `/plugin` interface or with CLI commands.

### Use the interactive interface

Run `/plugin` and go to the **Marketplaces** tab to:

* View all your added marketplaces with their sources and status
* Add new marketplaces
* Update marketplace listings to fetch the latest plugins
* Remove marketplaces you no longer need

### Use CLI commands

You can also manage marketplaces with direct commands.

List all configured marketplaces:

```shell  theme={null}
/plugin marketplace list
```

Refresh plugin listings from a marketplace:

```shell  theme={null}
/plugin marketplace update marketplace-name
```

Remove a marketplace:

```shell  theme={null}
/plugin marketplace remove marketplace-name
```

<Warning>
  Removing a marketplace will uninstall any plugins you installed from it.
</Warning>

### Configure auto-updates

Claude Code can automatically update marketplaces and their installed plugins at startup. When auto-update is enabled for a marketplace, Claude Code refreshes the marketplace data and updates installed plugins to their latest versions. If any plugins were updated, you'll see a notification suggesting you restart Claude Code.

Toggle auto-update for individual marketplaces through the UI:

1. Run `/plugin` to open the plugin manager
2. Select **Marketplaces**
3. Choose a marketplace from the list
4. Select **Enable auto-update** or **Disable auto-update**

Official Anthropic marketplaces have auto-update enabled by default. Third-party and local development marketplaces have auto-update disabled by default.

To disable all automatic updates entirely for both Claude Code and all plugins, set the `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER` environment variable. See [Auto updates](/en/setup#auto-updates) for details.

## Configure team marketplaces

Team admins can set up automatic marketplace installation for projects by adding marketplace configuration to `.claude/settings.json`. When team members trust the repository folder, Claude Code prompts them to install these marketplaces and plugins.

For full configuration options including `extraKnownMarketplaces` and `enabledPlugins`, see [Plugin settings](/en/settings#plugin-settings).

## Troubleshooting

### /plugin command not recognized

If you see "unknown command" or the `/plugin` command doesn't appear:

1. **Check your version**: Run `claude --version`. Plugins require version 1.0.33 or later.
2. **Update Claude Code**:
   * **Homebrew**: `brew upgrade claude-code`
   * **npm**: `npm update -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
   * **Native installer**: Re-run the install command from [Setup](/en/setup)
3. **Restart Claude Code**: After updating, restart your terminal and run `claude` again.

### Common issues

* **Marketplace not loading**: Verify the URL is accessible and that `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` exists at the path
* **Plugin installation failures**: Check that plugin source URLs are accessible and repositories are public (or you have access)
* **Files not found after installation**: Plugins are copied to a cache, so paths referencing files outside the plugin directory won't work

For detailed troubleshooting with solutions, see [Troubleshooting](/en/plugin-marketplaces#troubleshooting) in the marketplace guide. For debugging tools, see [Debugging and development tools](/en/plugins-reference#debugging-and-development-tools).

## Next steps

* **Build your own plugins**: See [Plugins](/en/plugins) to create custom commands, agents, and hooks
* **Create a marketplace**: See [Create a plugin marketplace](/en/plugin-marketplaces) to distribute plugins to your team or community
* **Technical reference**: See [Plugins reference](/en/plugins-reference) for complete specifications

# Agent Skills

> Create, manage, and share Skills to extend Claude's capabilities in Claude Code.

This guide shows you how to create, use, and manage Agent Skills in Claude Code. Skills are modular capabilities that extend Claude's functionality through organized folders containing instructions, scripts, and resources.

## Prerequisites

* Claude Code version 1.0 or later
* Basic familiarity with [Claude Code](/en/quickstart)

## What are Agent Skills?

Agent Skills package expertise into discoverable capabilities. Each Skill consists of a `SKILL.md` file with instructions that Claude reads when relevant, plus optional supporting files like scripts and templates.

**How Skills are invoked**: Skills are **model-invoked**—Claude autonomously decides when to use them based on your request and the Skill's description. This is different from slash commands, which are **user-invoked** (you explicitly type `/command` to trigger them).

**Benefits**:

* Extend Claude's capabilities for your specific workflows
* Share expertise across your team via git
* Reduce repetitive prompting
* Compose multiple Skills for complex tasks

Learn more in the [Agent Skills overview](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview).

<Note>
  For a deep dive into the architecture and real-world applications of Agent Skills, read our engineering blog: [Equipping agents for the real world with Agent Skills](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/equipping-agents-for-the-real-world-with-agent-skills).
</Note>

## Create a Skill

Skills are stored as directories containing a `SKILL.md` file.

### Personal Skills

Personal Skills are available across all your projects. Store them in `~/.claude/skills/`:

```bash  theme={null}
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/my-skill-name
```

**Use personal Skills for**:

* Your individual workflows and preferences
* Experimental Skills you're developing
* Personal productivity tools

### Project Skills

Project Skills are shared with your team. Store them in `.claude/skills/` within your project:

```bash  theme={null}
mkdir -p .claude/skills/my-skill-name
```

**Use project Skills for**:

* Team workflows and conventions
* Project-specific expertise
* Shared utilities and scripts

Project Skills are checked into git and automatically available to team members.

### Plugin Skills

Skills can also come from [Claude Code plugins](/en/plugins). Plugins may bundle Skills that are automatically available when the plugin is installed. These Skills work the same way as personal and project Skills.

## Write SKILL.md

Create a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter and Markdown content:

```yaml  theme={null}
---
name: your-skill-name
description: Brief description of what this Skill does and when to use it
---

# Your Skill Name

## Instructions
Provide clear, step-by-step guidance for Claude.

## Examples
Show concrete examples of using this Skill.
```

**Field requirements**:

* `name`: Must use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only (max 64 characters)
* `description`: Brief description of what the Skill does and when to use it (max 1024 characters)

The `description` field is critical for Claude to discover when to use your Skill. It should include both what the Skill does and when Claude should use it.

See the [best practices guide](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices) for complete authoring guidance including validation rules.

## Add supporting files

Create additional files alongside SKILL.md:

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md (required)
├── reference.md (optional documentation)
├── examples.md (optional examples)
├── scripts/
│   └── helper.py (optional utility)
└── templates/
    └── template.txt (optional template)
```

Reference these files from SKILL.md:

````markdown  theme={null}
For advanced usage, see [reference.md](reference.md).

Run the helper script:
```bash
python scripts/helper.py input.txt
```
````

Claude reads these files only when needed, using progressive disclosure to manage context efficiently.

## Restrict tool access with allowed-tools

Use the `allowed-tools` frontmatter field to limit which tools Claude can use when a Skill is active:

```yaml  theme={null}
---
name: safe-file-reader
description: Read files without making changes. Use when you need read-only file access.
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob
---

# Safe File Reader

This Skill provides read-only file access.

## Instructions
1. Use Read to view file contents
2. Use Grep to search within files
3. Use Glob to find files by pattern
```

When this Skill is active, Claude can only use the specified tools (Read, Grep, Glob) without needing to ask for permission. This is useful for:

* Read-only Skills that shouldn't modify files
* Skills with limited scope: for example, only data analysis, no file writing
* Security-sensitive workflows where you want to restrict capabilities

If `allowed-tools` isn't specified, Claude will ask for permission to use tools as normal, following the standard permission model.

<Note>
  `allowed-tools` is only supported for Skills in Claude Code.
</Note>

## View available Skills

Skills are automatically discovered by Claude from three sources:

* Personal Skills: `~/.claude/skills/`
* Project Skills: `.claude/skills/`
* Plugin Skills: bundled with installed plugins

**To view all available Skills**, ask Claude directly:

```
What Skills are available?
```

or

```
List all available Skills
```

This will show all Skills from all sources, including plugin Skills.

**To inspect a specific Skill**, you can also check the filesystem:

```bash  theme={null}
# List personal Skills
ls ~/.claude/skills/

# List project Skills (if in a project directory)
ls .claude/skills/

# View a specific Skill's content
cat ~/.claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
```

## Test a Skill

After creating a Skill, test it by asking questions that match your description.

**Example**: If your description mentions "PDF files":

```
Can you help me extract text from this PDF?
```

Claude autonomously decides to use your Skill if it matches the request—you don't need to explicitly invoke it. The Skill activates automatically based on the context of your question.

## Debug a Skill

If Claude doesn't use your Skill, check these common issues:

### Make description specific

**Too vague**:

```yaml  theme={null}
description: Helps with documents
```

**Specific**:

```yaml  theme={null}
description: Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents. Use when working with PDF files or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction.
```

Include both what the Skill does and when to use it in the description.

### Verify file path

**Personal Skills**: `~/.claude/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md`
**Project Skills**: `.claude/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md`

Check the file exists:

```bash  theme={null}
# Personal
ls ~/.claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md

# Project
ls .claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
```

### Check YAML syntax

Invalid YAML prevents the Skill from loading. Verify the frontmatter:

```bash  theme={null}
cat SKILL.md | head -n 10
```

Ensure:

* Opening `---` on line 1
* Closing `---` before Markdown content
* Valid YAML syntax (no tabs, correct indentation)

### View errors

Run Claude Code with debug mode to see Skill loading errors:

```bash  theme={null}
claude --debug
```

## Share Skills with your team

**Recommended approach**: Distribute Skills through [plugins](/en/plugins).

To share Skills via plugin:

1. Create a plugin with Skills in the `skills/` directory
2. Add the plugin to a marketplace
3. Team members install the plugin

For complete instructions, see [Add Skills to your plugin](/en/plugins#add-skills-to-your-plugin).

You can also share Skills directly through project repositories:

### Step 1: Add Skill to your project

Create a project Skill:

```bash  theme={null}
mkdir -p .claude/skills/team-skill
# Create SKILL.md
```

### Step 2: Commit to git

```bash  theme={null}
git add .claude/skills/
git commit -m "Add team Skill for PDF processing"
git push
```

### Step 3: Team members get Skills automatically

When team members pull the latest changes, Skills are immediately available:

```bash  theme={null}
git pull
claude  # Skills are now available
```

## Update a Skill

Edit SKILL.md directly:

```bash  theme={null}
# Personal Skill
code ~/.claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md

# Project Skill
code .claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
```

Changes take effect the next time you start Claude Code. If Claude Code is already running, restart it to load the updates.

## Remove a Skill

Delete the Skill directory:

```bash  theme={null}
# Personal
rm -rf ~/.claude/skills/my-skill

# Project
rm -rf .claude/skills/my-skill
git commit -m "Remove unused Skill"
```

## Best practices

### Keep Skills focused

One Skill should address one capability:

**Focused**:

* "PDF form filling"
* "Excel data analysis"
* "Git commit messages"

**Too broad**:

* "Document processing" (split into separate Skills)
* "Data tools" (split by data type or operation)

### Write clear descriptions

Help Claude discover when to use Skills by including specific triggers in your description:

**Clear**:

```yaml  theme={null}
description: Analyze Excel spreadsheets, create pivot tables, and generate charts. Use when working with Excel files, spreadsheets, or analyzing tabular data in .xlsx format.
```

**Vague**:

```yaml  theme={null}
description: For files
```

### Test with your team

Have teammates use Skills and provide feedback:

* Does the Skill activate when expected?
* Are the instructions clear?
* Are there missing examples or edge cases?

### Document Skill versions

You can document Skill versions in your SKILL.md content to track changes over time. Add a version history section:

```markdown  theme={null}
# My Skill

## Version History
- v2.0.0 (2025-10-01): Breaking changes to API
- v1.1.0 (2025-09-15): Added new features
- v1.0.0 (2025-09-01): Initial release
```

This helps team members understand what changed between versions.

## Troubleshooting

### Claude doesn't use my Skill

**Symptom**: You ask a relevant question but Claude doesn't use your Skill.

**Check**: Is the description specific enough?

Vague descriptions make discovery difficult. Include both what the Skill does and when to use it, with key terms users would mention.

**Too generic**:

```yaml  theme={null}
description: Helps with data
```

**Specific**:

```yaml  theme={null}
description: Analyze Excel spreadsheets, generate pivot tables, create charts. Use when working with Excel files, spreadsheets, or .xlsx files.
```

**Check**: Is the YAML valid?

Run validation to check for syntax errors:

```bash  theme={null}
# View frontmatter
cat .claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md | head -n 15

# Check for common issues
# - Missing opening or closing ---
# - Tabs instead of spaces
# - Unquoted strings with special characters
```

**Check**: Is the Skill in the correct location?

```bash  theme={null}
# Personal Skills
ls ~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md

# Project Skills
ls .claude/skills/*/SKILL.md
```

### Skill has errors

**Symptom**: The Skill loads but doesn't work correctly.

**Check**: Are dependencies available?

Claude will automatically install required dependencies (or ask for permission to install them) when it needs them.

**Check**: Do scripts have execute permissions?

```bash  theme={null}
chmod +x .claude/skills/my-skill/scripts/*.py
```

**Check**: Are file paths correct?

Use forward slashes (Unix style) in all paths:

**Correct**: `scripts/helper.py`
**Wrong**: `scripts\helper.py` (Windows style)

### Multiple Skills conflict

**Symptom**: Claude uses the wrong Skill or seems confused between similar Skills.

**Be specific in descriptions**: Help Claude choose the right Skill by using distinct trigger terms in your descriptions.

Instead of:

```yaml  theme={null}
# Skill 1
description: For data analysis

# Skill 2
description: For analyzing data
```

Use:

```yaml  theme={null}
# Skill 1
description: Analyze sales data in Excel files and CRM exports. Use for sales reports, pipeline analysis, and revenue tracking.

# Skill 2
description: Analyze log files and system metrics data. Use for performance monitoring, debugging, and system diagnostics.
```

## Examples

### Simple Skill (single file)

```
commit-helper/
└── SKILL.md
```

```yaml  theme={null}
---
name: generating-commit-messages
description: Generates clear commit messages from git diffs. Use when writing commit messages or reviewing staged changes.
---

# Generating Commit Messages

## Instructions

1. Run `git diff --staged` to see changes
2. I'll suggest a commit message with:
   - Summary under 50 characters
   - Detailed description
   - Affected components

## Best practices

- Use present tense
- Explain what and why, not how
```

### Skill with tool permissions

```
code-reviewer/
└── SKILL.md
```

```yaml  theme={null}
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Review code for best practices and potential issues. Use when reviewing code, checking PRs, or analyzing code quality.

4. Security concerns
5. Test coverage

## Instructions

1. Read the target files using Read tool
2. Search for patterns using Grep
3. Find related files using Glob
4. Provide detailed feedback on code quality
```

### Multi-file Skill

```
pdf-processing/
├── SKILL.md
├── FORMS.md
├── REFERENCE.md
└── scripts/
    ├── fill_form.py
    └── validate.py
```

**SKILL.md**:

````yaml  theme={null}
---
name: pdf-processing
description: Extract text, fill forms, merge PDFs. Use when working with PDF files, forms, or document extraction. Requires pypdf and pdfplumber packages.
---

# PDF Processing

## Quick start

Extract text:
```python
import pdfplumber
with pdfplumber.open("doc.pdf") as pdf:
    text = pdf.pages[0].extract_text()
```

For form filling, see [FORMS.md](FORMS.md).
For detailed API reference, see [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md).

## Requirements

Packages must be installed in your environment:
```bash
pip install pypdf pdfplumber
```
````

<Note>
  List required packages in the description. Packages must be installed in your environment before Claude can use them.
</Note>

Claude loads additional files only when needed.

# Output styles

> Adapt Claude Code for uses beyond software engineering

Output styles allow you to use Claude Code as any type of agent while keeping
its core capabilities, such as running local scripts, reading/writing files, and
tracking TODOs.

## Built-in output styles

Claude Code's **Default** output style is the existing system prompt, designed
to help you complete software engineering tasks efficiently.

There are two additional built-in output styles focused on teaching you the
codebase and how Claude operates:

* **Explanatory**: Provides educational "Insights" in between helping you
  complete software engineering tasks. Helps you understand implementation
  choices and codebase patterns.

* **Learning**: Collaborative, learn-by-doing mode where Claude will not only
  share "Insights" while coding, but also ask you to contribute small, strategic
  pieces of code yourself. Claude Code will add `TODO(human)` markers in your
  code for you to implement.

## How output styles work

Output styles directly modify Claude Code's system prompt.

* All output styles exclude instructions for efficient output (such as
  responding concisely).
* Custom output styles exclude instructions for coding (such as verifying code
  with tests), unless `keep-coding-instructions` is true.
* All output styles have their own custom instructions added to the end of the
  system prompt.
* All output styles trigger reminders for Claude to adhere to the output style
  instructions during the conversation.

## Change your output style

You can either:

* Run `/output-style` to access a menu and select your output style (this can
  also be accessed from the `/config` menu)

* Run `/output-style [style]`, such as `/output-style explanatory`, to directly
  switch to a style

These changes apply to the [local project level](/en/settings) and are saved in
`.claude/settings.local.json`. You can also directly edit the `outputStyle`
field in a settings file at a different level.

## Create a custom output style

Custom output styles are Markdown files with frontmatter and the text that will
be added to the system prompt:

```markdown  theme={null}
---
name: My Custom Style
description:
  A brief description of what this style does, to be displayed to the user
---

# Custom Style Instructions

You are an interactive CLI tool that helps users with software engineering
tasks. [Your custom instructions here...]

## Specific Behaviors

[Define how the assistant should behave in this style...]
```

You can save these files at the user level (`~/.claude/output-styles`) or
project level (`.claude/output-styles`).

### Frontmatter

Output style files support frontmatter, useful for specifying metadata about the
command:

| Frontmatter                | Purpose                                                                     | Default                 |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------- |
| `name`                     | Name of the output style, if not the file name                              | Inherits from file name |
| `description`              | Description of the output style. Used only in the UI of `/output-style`     | None                    |
| `keep-coding-instructions` | Whether to keep the parts of Claude Code's system prompt related to coding. | false                   |

## Comparisons to related features

### Output Styles vs. CLAUDE.md vs. --append-system-prompt

Output styles completely "turn off" the parts of Claude Code's default system
prompt specific to software engineering. Neither CLAUDE.md nor
`--append-system-prompt` edit Claude Code's default system prompt. CLAUDE.md
adds the contents as a user message *following* Claude Code's default system
prompt. `--append-system-prompt` appends the content to the system prompt.

### Output Styles vs. [Agents](/en/sub-agents)

Output styles directly affect the main agent loop and only affect the system
prompt. Agents are invoked to handle specific tasks and can include additional
settings like the model to use, the tools they have available, and some context
about when to use the agent.

### Output Styles vs. [Custom Slash Commands](/en/slash-commands)

You can think of output styles as "stored system prompts" and custom slash
commands as "stored prompts".

# Get started with Claude Code hooks

> Learn how to customize and extend Claude Code's behavior by registering shell commands

Claude Code hooks are user-defined shell commands that execute at various points
in Claude Code's lifecycle. Hooks provide deterministic control over Claude
Code's behavior, ensuring certain actions always happen rather than relying on
the LLM to choose to run them.

<Tip>
  For reference documentation on hooks, see [Hooks reference](/en/hooks).
</Tip>

Example use cases for hooks include:

* **Notifications**: Customize how you get notified when Claude Code is awaiting
  your input or permission to run something.
* **Automatic formatting**: Run `prettier` on .ts files, `gofmt` on .go files,
  etc. after every file edit.
* **Logging**: Track and count all executed commands for compliance or
  debugging.
* **Feedback**: Provide automated feedback when Claude Code produces code that
  does not follow your codebase conventions.
* **Custom permissions**: Block modifications to production files or sensitive
  directories.

By encoding these rules as hooks rather than prompting instructions, you turn
suggestions into app-level code that executes every time it is expected to run.

<Warning>
  You must consider the security implication of hooks as you add them, because hooks run automatically during the agent loop with your current environment's credentials.
  For example, malicious hooks code can exfiltrate your data. Always review your hooks implementation before registering them.

  For full security best practices, see [Security Considerations](/en/hooks#security-considerations) in the hooks reference documentation.
</Warning>

## Hook Events Overview

Claude Code provides several hook events that run at different points in the
workflow:

* **PreToolUse**: Runs before tool calls (can block them)
* **PermissionRequest**: Runs when a permission dialog is shown (can allow or deny)
* **PostToolUse**: Runs after tool calls complete
* **UserPromptSubmit**: Runs when the user submits a prompt, before Claude processes it
* **Notification**: Runs when Claude Code sends notifications
* **Stop**: Runs when Claude Code finishes responding
* **SubagentStop**: Runs when subagent tasks complete
* **PreCompact**: Runs before Claude Code is about to run a compact operation
* **SessionStart**: Runs when Claude Code starts a new session or resumes an existing session
* **SessionEnd**: Runs when Claude Code session ends

Each event receives different data and can control Claude's behavior in
different ways.

## Quickstart

In this quickstart, you'll add a hook that logs the shell commands that Claude
Code runs.

### Prerequisites

Install `jq` for JSON processing in the command line.

### Step 1: Open hooks configuration

Run the `/hooks` [slash command](/en/slash-commands) and select
the `PreToolUse` hook event.

`PreToolUse` hooks run before tool calls and can block them while providing
Claude feedback on what to do differently.

### Step 2: Add a matcher

Select `+ Add new matcher…` to run your hook only on Bash tool calls.

Type `Bash` for the matcher.

<Note>You can use `*` to match all tools.</Note>

### Step 3: Add the hook

Select `+ Add new hook…` and enter this command:

```bash  theme={null}
jq -r '"\(.tool_input.command) - \(.tool_input.description // "No description")"' >> ~/.claude/bash-command-log.txt
```

### Step 4: Save your configuration

For storage location, select `User settings` since you're logging to your home
directory. This hook will then apply to all projects, not just your current
project.

Then press `Esc` until you return to the REPL. Your hook is now registered.

### Step 5: Verify your hook

Run `/hooks` again or check `~/.claude/settings.json` to see your configuration:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "jq -r '\"\\(.tool_input.command) - \\(.tool_input.description // \"No description\")\"' >> ~/.claude/bash-command-log.txt"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 6: Test your hook

Ask Claude to run a simple command like `ls` and check your log file:

```bash  theme={null}
cat ~/.claude/bash-command-log.txt
```

You should see entries like:

```
ls - Lists files and directories
```

## More Examples

<Note>
  For a complete example implementation, see the [bash command validator example](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/examples/hooks/bash_command_validator_example.py) in our public codebase.
</Note>

### Code Formatting Hook

Automatically format TypeScript files after editing:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "jq -r '.tool_input.file_path' | { read file_path; if echo \"$file_path\" | grep -q '\\.ts$'; then npx prettier --write \"$file_path\"; fi; }"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Markdown Formatting Hook

Automatically fix missing language tags and formatting issues in markdown files:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "\"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\"/.claude/hooks/markdown_formatter.py"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Create `.claude/hooks/markdown_formatter.py` with this content:

````python  theme={null}
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Markdown formatter for Claude Code output.
Fixes missing language tags and spacing issues while preserving code content.
"""
import json
import sys
import re
import os

def detect_language(code):
    """Best-effort language detection from code content."""
    s = code.strip()
    
    # JSON detection
    if re.search(r'^\s*[{\[]', s):
        try:
            json.loads(s)
            return 'json'
        except:
            pass
    
    # Python detection
    if re.search(r'^\s*def\s+\w+\s*\(', s, re.M) or \
       re.search(r'^\s*(import|from)\s+\w+', s, re.M):
        return 'python'
    
    # JavaScript detection  
    if re.search(r'\b(function\s+\w+\s*\(|const\s+\w+\s*=)', s) or \
       re.search(r'=>|console\.(log|error)', s):
        return 'javascript'
    
    # Bash detection
    if re.search(r'^#!.*\b(bash|sh)\b', s, re.M) or \
       re.search(r'\b(if|then|fi|for|in|do|done)\b', s):
        return 'bash'
    
    # SQL detection
    if re.search(r'\b(SELECT|INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE|CREATE)\s+', s, re.I):
        return 'sql'
        
    return 'text'

def format_markdown(content):
    """Format markdown content with language detection."""
    # Fix unlabeled code fences
    def add_lang_to_fence(match):
        indent, info, body, closing = match.groups()
        if not info.strip():
            lang = detect_language(body)
            return f"{indent}```{lang}\n{body}{closing}\n"
        return match.group(0)
    
    fence_pattern = r'(?ms)^([ \t]{0,3})```([^\n]*)\n(.*?)(\n\1```)\s*$'
    content = re.sub(fence_pattern, add_lang_to_fence, content)
    
    # Fix excessive blank lines (only outside code fences)
    content = re.sub(r'\n{3,}', '\n\n', content)
    
    return content.rstrip() + '\n'

# Main execution
try:
    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)
    file_path = input_data.get('tool_input', {}).get('file_path', '')
    
    if not file_path.endswith(('.md', '.mdx')):
        sys.exit(0)  # Not a markdown file
    
    if os.path.exists(file_path):
        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            content = f.read()
        
        formatted = format_markdown(content)
        
        if formatted != content:
            with open(file_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
                f.write(formatted)
            print(f"✓ Fixed markdown formatting in {file_path}")
    
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error formatting markdown: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
    sys.exit(1)
````

Make the script executable:

```bash  theme={null}
chmod +x .claude/hooks/markdown_formatter.py
```

This hook automatically:

* Detects programming languages in unlabeled code blocks
* Adds appropriate language tags for syntax highlighting
* Fixes excessive blank lines while preserving code content
* Only processes markdown files (`.md`, `.mdx`)

### Custom Notification Hook

Get desktop notifications when Claude needs input:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "hooks": {
    "Notification": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "notify-send 'Claude Code' 'Awaiting your input'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### File Protection Hook

Block edits to sensitive files:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 -c \"import json, sys; data=json.load(sys.stdin); path=data.get('tool_input',{}).get('file_path',''); sys.exit(2 if any(p in path for p in ['.env', 'package-lock.json', '.git/']) else 0)\""
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

# Run Claude Code programmatically

> Use the Agent SDK to run Claude Code programmatically from the CLI, Python, or TypeScript.

The [Agent SDK](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview) gives you the same tools, agent loop, and context management that power Claude Code. It's available as a CLI for scripts and CI/CD, or as [Python](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/python) and [TypeScript](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/typescript) packages for full programmatic control.

<Note>
  The CLI was previously called "headless mode." The `-p` flag and all CLI options work the same way.
</Note>

To run Claude Code programmatically from the CLI, pass `-p` with your prompt and any [CLI options](/en/cli-reference):

```bash  theme={null}
claude -p "Find and fix the bug in auth.py" --allowedTools "Read,Edit,Bash"
```

This page covers using the Agent SDK via the CLI (`claude -p`). For the Python and TypeScript SDK packages with structured outputs, tool approval callbacks, and native message objects, see the [full Agent SDK documentation](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview).

## Basic usage

Add the `-p` (or `--print`) flag to any `claude` command to run it non-interactively. All [CLI options](/en/cli-reference) work with `-p`, including:

* `--continue` for [continuing conversations](#continue-conversations)
* `--allowedTools` for [auto-approving tools](#auto-approve-tools)
* `--output-format` for [structured output](#get-structured-output)

This example asks Claude a question about your codebase and prints the response:

```bash  theme={null}
claude -p "What does the auth module do?"
```

## Examples

These examples highlight common CLI patterns.

### Get structured output

Use `--output-format` to control how responses are returned:

* `text` (default): plain text output
* `json`: structured JSON with result, session ID, and metadata
* `stream-json`: newline-delimited JSON for real-time streaming

```bash  theme={null}
claude -p "Summarize this project" --output-format json
```

### Auto-approve tools

Use `--allowedTools` to let Claude use certain tools without prompting. This example runs a test suite and fixes failures, allowing Claude to execute Bash commands and read/edit files without asking for permission:

```bash  theme={null}
claude -p "Run the test suite and fix any failures" \
  --allowedTools "Bash,Read,Edit"
```

### Create a commit

This example reviews staged changes and creates a commit with an appropriate message:

```bash  theme={null}
claude -p "Look at my staged changes and create an appropriate commit" \
  --allowedTools "Bash(git diff:*),Bash(git log:*),Bash(git status:*),Bash(git commit:*)"
```

<Note>
  [Slash commands](/en/slash-commands) like `/commit` are only available in interactive mode. In `-p` mode, describe the task you want to accomplish instead.
</Note>

### Customize the system prompt

Use `--append-system-prompt` to add instructions while keeping Claude Code's default behavior. This example pipes a PR diff to Claude and instructs it to review for security vulnerabilities:

```bash  theme={null}
gh pr diff "$1" | claude -p \
  --append-system-prompt "You are a security engineer. Review for vulnerabilities." \
  --output-format json
```

See [system prompt flags](/en/cli-reference#system-prompt-flags) for more options including `--system-prompt` to fully replace the default prompt.

### Continue conversations

Use `--continue` to continue the most recent conversation, or `--resume` with a session ID to continue a specific conversation. This example runs a review, then sends follow-up prompts:

```bash  theme={null}
# First request
claude -p "Review this codebase for performance issues"

# Continue the most recent conversation
claude -p "Now focus on the database queries" --continue
claude -p "Generate a summary of all issues found" --continue
```

If you're running multiple conversations, capture the session ID to resume a specific one:

```bash  theme={null}
session_id=$(claude -p "Start a review" --output-format json | jq -r '.session_id')
claude -p "Continue that review" --resume "$session_id"
```

Claude Code can connect to hundreds of external tools and data sources through the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction), an open source standard for AI-tool integrations. MCP servers give Claude Code access to your tools, databases, and APIs.

## What you can do with MCP

With MCP servers connected, you can ask Claude Code to:

* **Implement features from issue trackers**: "Add the feature described in JIRA issue ENG-4521 and create a PR on GitHub."
* **Analyze monitoring data**: "Check Sentry and Statsig to check the usage of the feature described in ENG-4521."
* **Query databases**: "Find emails of 10 random users who used feature ENG-4521, based on our PostgreSQL database."
* **Integrate designs**: "Update our standard email template based on the new Figma designs that were posted in Slack"
* **Automate workflows**: "Create Gmail drafts inviting these 10 users to a feedback session about the new feature."

## Popular MCP servers

Here are some commonly used MCP servers you can connect to Claude Code:

<Warning>
  Use third party MCP servers at your own risk - Anthropic has not verified
  the correctness or security of all these servers.
  Make sure you trust MCP servers you are installing.
  Be especially careful when using MCP servers that could fetch untrusted
  content, as these can expose you to prompt injection risk.
</Warning>

<MCPServersTable platform="claudeCode" />

<Note>
  **Need a specific integration?** [Find hundreds more MCP servers on GitHub](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers), or build your own using the [MCP SDK](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server).
</Note>

## Installing MCP servers

MCP servers can be configured in three different ways depending on your needs:

### Option 1: Add a remote HTTP server

HTTP servers are the recommended option for connecting to remote MCP servers. This is the most widely supported transport for cloud-based services.

```bash  theme={null}
# Basic syntax
claude mcp add --transport http <name> <url>

# Real example: Connect to Notion
claude mcp add --transport http notion https://mcp.notion.com/mcp

# Example with Bearer token
claude mcp add --transport http secure-api https://api.example.com/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer your-token"
```

### Option 2: Add a remote SSE server

<Warning>
  The SSE (Server-Sent Events) transport is deprecated. Use HTTP servers instead, where available.
</Warning>

```bash  theme={null}
# Basic syntax
claude mcp add --transport sse <name> <url>

# Real example: Connect to Asana
claude mcp add --transport sse asana https://mcp.asana.com/sse

# Example with authentication header
claude mcp add --transport sse private-api https://api.company.com/sse \
  --header "X-API-Key: your-key-here"
```

### Option 3: Add a local stdio server

Stdio servers run as local processes on your machine. They're ideal for tools that need direct system access or custom scripts.

```bash  theme={null}
# Basic syntax
claude mcp add --transport stdio <name> <command> [args...]

# Real example: Add Airtable server
claude mcp add --transport stdio airtable --env AIRTABLE_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY \
  -- npx -y airtable-mcp-server
```

<Note>
  **Understanding the "--" parameter:**
  The `--` (double dash) separates Claude's own CLI flags from the command and arguments that get passed to the MCP server. Everything before `--` are options for Claude (like `--env`, `--scope`), and everything after `--` is the actual command to run the MCP server.

  For example:

  * `claude mcp add --transport stdio myserver -- npx server` → runs `npx server`
  * `claude mcp add --transport stdio myserver --env KEY=value -- python server.py --port 8080` → runs `python server.py --port 8080` with `KEY=value` in environment

  This prevents conflicts between Claude's flags and the server's flags.
</Note>

### Managing your servers

Once configured, you can manage your MCP servers with these commands:

```bash  theme={null}
# List all configured servers
claude mcp list

# Get details for a specific server
claude mcp get github

# Remove a server
claude mcp remove github

# (within Claude Code) Check server status
/mcp
```

<Tip>
  Tips:

  * Use the `--scope` flag to specify where the configuration is stored:
    * `local` (default): Available only to you in the current project (was called `project` in older versions)
    * `project`: Shared with everyone in the project via `.mcp.json` file
    * `user`: Available to you across all projects (was called `global` in older versions)
  * Set environment variables with `--env` flags (for example, `--env KEY=value`)
  * Configure MCP server startup timeout using the MCP\_TIMEOUT environment variable (for example, `MCP_TIMEOUT=10000 claude` sets a 10-second timeout)
  * Claude Code will display a warning when MCP tool output exceeds 10,000 tokens. To increase this limit, set the `MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS` environment variable (for example, `MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS=50000`)
  * Use `/mcp` to authenticate with remote servers that require OAuth 2.0 authentication
</Tip>

<Warning>
  **Windows Users**: On native Windows (not WSL), local MCP servers that use `npx` require the `cmd /c` wrapper to ensure proper execution.

  ```bash  theme={null}
  # This creates command="cmd" which Windows can execute
  claude mcp add --transport stdio my-server -- cmd /c npx -y @some/package
  ```

  Without the `cmd /c` wrapper, you'll encounter "Connection closed" errors because Windows cannot directly execute `npx`. (See the note above for an explanation of the `--` parameter.)
</Warning>

### Plugin-provided MCP servers

[Plugins](/en/plugins) can bundle MCP servers, automatically providing tools and integrations when the plugin is enabled. Plugin MCP servers work identically to user-configured servers.

**How plugin MCP servers work**:

* Plugins define MCP servers in `.mcp.json` at the plugin root or inline in `plugin.json`
* When a plugin is enabled, its MCP servers start automatically
* Plugin MCP tools appear alongside manually configured MCP tools
* Plugin servers are managed through plugin installation (not `/mcp` commands)

**Example plugin MCP configuration**:

In `.mcp.json` at plugin root:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "database-tools": {
    "command": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/servers/db-server",
    "args": ["--config", "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/config.json"],
    "env": {
      "DB_URL": "${DB_URL}"
    }
  }
}
```

Or inline in `plugin.json`:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "mcpServers": {
    "plugin-api": {
      "command": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/servers/api-server",
      "args": ["--port", "8080"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Plugin MCP features**:

* **Automatic lifecycle**: Servers start when plugin enables, but you must restart Claude Code to apply MCP server changes (enabling or disabling)
* **Environment variables**: Use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` for plugin-relative paths
* **User environment access**: Access to same environment variables as manually configured servers
* **Multiple transport types**: Support stdio, SSE, and HTTP transports (transport support may vary by server)

**Viewing plugin MCP servers**:

```bash  theme={null}
# Within Claude Code, see all MCP servers including plugin ones
/mcp
```

Plugin servers appear in the list with indicators showing they come from plugins.

**Benefits of plugin MCP servers**:

* **Bundled distribution**: Tools and servers packaged together
* **Automatic setup**: No manual MCP configuration needed
* **Team consistency**: Everyone gets the same tools when plugin is installed

See the [plugin components reference](/en/plugins-reference#mcp-servers) for details on bundling MCP servers with plugins.

## MCP installation scopes

MCP servers can be configured at three different scope levels, each serving distinct purposes for managing server accessibility and sharing. Understanding these scopes helps you determine the best way to configure servers for your specific needs.

### Local scope

Local-scoped servers represent the default configuration level and are stored in `~/.claude.json` under your project's path. These servers remain private to you and are only accessible when working within the current project directory. This scope is ideal for personal development servers, experimental configurations, or servers containing sensitive credentials that shouldn't be shared.

```bash  theme={null}
# Add a local-scoped server (default)
claude mcp add --transport http stripe https://mcp.stripe.com

# Explicitly specify local scope
claude mcp add --transport http stripe --scope local https://mcp.stripe.com
```

### Project scope

Project-scoped servers enable team collaboration by storing configurations in a `.mcp.json` file at your project's root directory. This file is designed to be checked into version control, ensuring all team members have access to the same MCP tools and services. When you add a project-scoped server, Claude Code automatically creates or updates this file with the appropriate configuration structure.

```bash  theme={null}
# Add a project-scoped server
claude mcp add --transport http paypal --scope project https://mcp.paypal.com/mcp
```

The resulting `.mcp.json` file follows a standardized format:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "shared-server": {
      "command": "/path/to/server",
      "args": [],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

For security reasons, Claude Code prompts for approval before using project-scoped servers from `.mcp.json` files. If you need to reset these approval choices, use the `claude mcp reset-project-choices` command.

### User scope

User-scoped servers are stored in `~/.claude.json` and provide cross-project accessibility, making them available across all projects on your machine while remaining private to your user account. This scope works well for personal utility servers, development tools, or services you frequently use across different projects.

```bash  theme={null}
# Add a user server
claude mcp add --transport http hubspot --scope user https://mcp.hubspot.com/anthropic
```

### Choosing the right scope

Select your scope based on:

* **Local scope**: Personal servers, experimental configurations, or sensitive credentials specific to one project
* **Project scope**: Team-shared servers, project-specific tools, or services required for collaboration
* **User scope**: Personal utilities needed across multiple projects, development tools, or frequently used services

<Note>
  **Where are MCP servers stored?**

  * **User and local scope**: `~/.claude.json` (in the `mcpServers` field or under project paths)
  * **Project scope**: `.mcp.json` in your project root (checked into source control)
  * **Enterprise managed**: `managed-mcp.json` in system directories (see [Enterprise MCP configuration](#enterprise-mcp-configuration))
</Note>

### Scope hierarchy and precedence

MCP server configurations follow a clear precedence hierarchy. When servers with the same name exist at multiple scopes, the system resolves conflicts by prioritizing local-scoped servers first, followed by project-scoped servers, and finally user-scoped servers. This design ensures that personal configurations can override shared ones when needed.

### Environment variable expansion in `.mcp.json`

Claude Code supports environment variable expansion in `.mcp.json` files, allowing teams to share configurations while maintaining flexibility for machine-specific paths and sensitive values like API keys.

**Supported syntax:**

* `${VAR}` - Expands to the value of environment variable `VAR`
* `${VAR:-default}` - Expands to `VAR` if set, otherwise uses `default`

**Expansion locations:**
Environment variables can be expanded in:

* `command` - The server executable path
* `args` - Command-line arguments
* `env` - Environment variables passed to the server
* `url` - For HTTP server types
* `headers` - For HTTP server authentication

**Example with variable expansion:**

```json  theme={null}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "api-server": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "${API_BASE_URL:-https://api.example.com}/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${API_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If a required environment variable is not set and has no default value, Claude Code will fail to parse the config.

## Practical examples

{/* ### Example: Automate browser testing with Playwright

  ```bash
  # 1. Add the Playwright MCP server
  claude mcp add --transport stdio playwright -- npx -y @playwright/mcp@latest

  # 2. Write and run browser tests
  > "Test if the login flow works with test@example.com"
  > "Take a screenshot of the checkout page on mobile"
  > "Verify that the search feature returns results"
  ``` */}

### Example: Monitor errors with Sentry

```bash  theme={null}
# 1. Add the Sentry MCP server
claude mcp add --transport http sentry https://mcp.sentry.dev/mcp

# 2. Use /mcp to authenticate with your Sentry account
> /mcp

# 3. Debug production issues
> "What are the most common errors in the last 24 hours?"
> "Show me the stack trace for error ID abc123"
> "Which deployment introduced these new errors?"
```

### Example: Connect to GitHub for code reviews

```bash  theme={null}
# 1. Add the GitHub MCP server
claude mcp add --transport http github https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/

# 2. In Claude Code, authenticate if needed
> /mcp
# Select "Authenticate" for GitHub

# 3. Now you can ask Claude to work with GitHub
> "Review PR #456 and suggest improvements"
> "Create a new issue for the bug we just found"
> "Show me all open PRs assigned to me"
```

### Example: Query your PostgreSQL database

```bash  theme={null}
# 1. Add the database server with your connection string
claude mcp add --transport stdio db -- npx -y @bytebase/dbhub \
  --dsn "postgresql://readonly:pass@prod.db.com:5432/analytics"

# 2. Query your database naturally
> "What's our total revenue this month?"
> "Show me the schema for the orders table"
> "Find customers who haven't made a purchase in 90 days"
```

## Authenticate with remote MCP servers

Many cloud-based MCP servers require authentication. Claude Code supports OAuth 2.0 for secure connections.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add the server that requires authentication">
    For example:

    ```bash  theme={null}
    claude mcp add --transport http sentry https://mcp.sentry.dev/mcp
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use the /mcp command within Claude Code">
    In Claude code, use the command:

    ```
    > /mcp
    ```

    Then follow the steps in your browser to login.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

  * Authentication tokens are stored securely and refreshed automatically
  * Use "Clear authentication" in the `/mcp` menu to revoke access
  * If your browser doesn't open automatically, copy the provided URL
  * OAuth authentication works with HTTP servers
</Tip>

## Add MCP servers from JSON configuration

If you have a JSON configuration for an MCP server, you can add it directly:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add an MCP server from JSON">
    ```bash  theme={null}
    # Basic syntax
    claude mcp add-json <name> '<json>'

    # Example: Adding an HTTP server with JSON configuration
    claude mcp add-json weather-api '{"type":"http","url":"https://api.weather.com/mcp","headers":{"Authorization":"Bearer token"}}'

    # Example: Adding a stdio server with JSON configuration
    claude mcp add-json local-weather '{"type":"stdio","command":"/path/to/weather-cli","args":["--api-key","abc123"],"env":{"CACHE_DIR":"/tmp"}}'
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify the server was added">
    ```bash  theme={null}
    claude mcp get weather-api
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

  * Make sure the JSON is properly escaped in your shell
  * The JSON must conform to the MCP server configuration schema
  * You can use `--scope user` to add the server to your user configuration instead of the project-specific one
</Tip>

## Import MCP servers from Claude Desktop

If you've already configured MCP servers in Claude Desktop, you can import them:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Import servers from Claude Desktop">
    ```bash  theme={null}
    # Basic syntax 
    claude mcp add-from-claude-desktop 
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select which servers to import">
    After running the command, you'll see an interactive dialog that allows you to select which servers you want to import.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify the servers were imported">
    ```bash  theme={null}
    claude mcp list 
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

  * This feature only works on macOS and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
  * It reads the Claude Desktop configuration file from its standard location on those platforms
  * Use the `--scope user` flag to add servers to your user configuration
  * Imported servers will have the same names as in Claude Desktop
  * If servers with the same names already exist, they will get a numerical suffix (for example, `server_1`)
</Tip>

## Use Claude Code as an MCP server

You can use Claude Code itself as an MCP server that other applications can connect to:

```bash  theme={null}
# Start Claude as a stdio MCP server
claude mcp serve
```

You can use this in Claude Desktop by adding this configuration to claude\_desktop\_config.json:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "claude-code": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "claude",
      "args": ["mcp", "serve"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

<Warning>
  **Configuring the executable path**: The `command` field must reference the Claude Code executable. If the `claude` command is not in your system's PATH, you'll need to specify the full path to the executable.

  To find the full path:

  ```bash  theme={null}
  which claude
  ```

  Then use the full path in your configuration:

  ```json  theme={null}
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "claude-code": {
        "type": "stdio",
        "command": "/full/path/to/claude",
        "args": ["mcp", "serve"],
        "env": {}
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  Without the correct executable path, you'll encounter errors like `spawn claude ENOENT`.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  Tips:

  * The server provides access to Claude's tools like View, Edit, LS, etc.
  * In Claude Desktop, try asking Claude to read files in a directory, make edits, and more.
  * Note that this MCP server is only exposing Claude Code's tools to your MCP client, so your own client is responsible for implementing user confirmation for individual tool calls.
</Tip>

## MCP output limits and warnings

When MCP tools produce large outputs, Claude Code helps manage the token usage to prevent overwhelming your conversation context:

* **Output warning threshold**: Claude Code displays a warning when any MCP tool output exceeds 10,000 tokens
* **Configurable limit**: You can adjust the maximum allowed MCP output tokens using the `MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS` environment variable
* **Default limit**: The default maximum is 25,000 tokens

To increase the limit for tools that produce large outputs:

```bash  theme={null}
# Set a higher limit for MCP tool outputs
export MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS=50000
claude
```

This is particularly useful when working with MCP servers that:

* Query large datasets or databases
* Generate detailed reports or documentation
* Process extensive log files or debugging information

<Warning>
  If you frequently encounter output warnings with specific MCP servers, consider increasing the limit or configuring the server to paginate or filter its responses.
</Warning>

## Use MCP resources

MCP servers can expose resources that you can reference using @ mentions, similar to how you reference files.

### Reference MCP resources

<Steps>
  <Step title="List available resources">
    Type `@` in your prompt to see available resources from all connected MCP servers. Resources appear alongside files in the autocomplete menu.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Reference a specific resource">
    Use the format `@server:protocol://resource/path` to reference a resource:

    ```
    > Can you analyze @github:issue://123 and suggest a fix?
    ```

    ```
    > Please review the API documentation at @docs:file://api/authentication
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Multiple resource references">
    You can reference multiple resources in a single prompt:

    ```
    > Compare @postgres:schema://users with @docs:file://database/user-model
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

  * Resources are automatically fetched and included as attachments when referenced
  * Resource paths are fuzzy-searchable in the @ mention autocomplete
  * Claude Code automatically provides tools to list and read MCP resources when servers support them
  * Resources can contain any type of content that the MCP server provides (text, JSON, structured data, etc.)
</Tip>

## Use MCP prompts as slash commands

MCP servers can expose prompts that become available as slash commands in Claude Code.

### Execute MCP prompts

<Steps>
  <Step title="Discover available prompts">
    Type `/` to see all available commands, including those from MCP servers. MCP prompts appear with the format `/mcp__servername__promptname`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Execute a prompt without arguments">
    ```
    > /mcp__github__list_prs
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Execute a prompt with arguments">
    Many prompts accept arguments. Pass them space-separated after the command:

    ```
    > /mcp__github__pr_review 456
    ```

    ```
    > /mcp__jira__create_issue "Bug in login flow" high
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

  * MCP prompts are dynamically discovered from connected servers
  * Arguments are parsed based on the prompt's defined parameters
  * Prompt results are injected directly into the conversation
  * Server and prompt names are normalized (spaces become underscores)
</Tip>

## Enterprise MCP configuration

For organizations that need centralized control over MCP servers, Claude Code supports two enterprise configuration options:

1. **Exclusive control with `managed-mcp.json`**: Deploy a fixed set of MCP servers that users cannot modify or extend
2. **Policy-based control with allowlists/denylists**: Allow users to add their own servers, but restrict which ones are permitted

These options allow IT administrators to:

* **Control which MCP servers employees can access**: Deploy a standardized set of approved MCP servers across the organization
* **Prevent unauthorized MCP servers**: Restrict users from adding unapproved MCP servers
* **Disable MCP entirely**: Remove MCP functionality completely if needed

### Option 1: Exclusive control with managed-mcp.json

When you deploy a `managed-mcp.json` file, it takes **exclusive control** over all MCP servers. Users cannot add, modify, or use any MCP servers other than those defined in this file. This is the simplest approach for organizations that want complete control.

System administrators deploy the configuration file to a system-wide directory:

* macOS: `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-mcp.json`
* Linux and WSL: `/etc/claude-code/managed-mcp.json`
* Windows: `C:\Program Files\ClaudeCode\managed-mcp.json`

<Note>
  These are system-wide paths (not user home directories like `~/Library/...`) that require administrator privileges. They are designed to be deployed by IT administrators.
</Note>

The `managed-mcp.json` file uses the same format as a standard `.mcp.json` file:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/"
    },
    "sentry": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.sentry.dev/mcp"
    },
    "company-internal": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/company-mcp-server",
      "args": ["--config", "/etc/company/mcp-config.json"],
      "env": {
        "COMPANY_API_URL": "https://internal.company.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Policy-based control with allowlists and denylists

Instead of taking exclusive control, administrators can allow users to configure their own MCP servers while enforcing restrictions on which servers are permitted. This approach uses `allowedMcpServers` and `deniedMcpServers` in the [managed settings file](/en/settings#settings-files).

<Note>
  **Choosing between options**: Use Option 1 (`managed-mcp.json`) when you want to deploy a fixed set of servers with no user customization. Use Option 2 (allowlists/denylists) when you want to allow users to add their own servers within policy constraints.
</Note>

#### Restriction options

Each entry in the allowlist or denylist can restrict servers in three ways:

1. **By server name** (`serverName`): Matches the configured name of the server
2. **By command** (`serverCommand`): Matches the exact command and arguments used to start stdio servers
3. **By URL pattern** (`serverUrl`): Matches remote server URLs with wildcard support

**Important**: Each entry must have exactly one of `serverName`, `serverCommand`, or `serverUrl`.

#### Example configuration

```json  theme={null}
{
  "allowedMcpServers": [
    // Allow by server name
    { "serverName": "github" },
    { "serverName": "sentry" },

    // Allow by exact command (for stdio servers)
    { "serverCommand": ["npx", "-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem"] },
    { "serverCommand": ["python", "/usr/local/bin/approved-server.py"] },

    // Allow by URL pattern (for remote servers)
    { "serverUrl": "https://mcp.company.com/*" },
    { "serverUrl": "https://*.internal.corp/*" }
  ],
  "deniedMcpServers": [
    // Block by server name
    { "serverName": "dangerous-server" },

    // Block by exact command (for stdio servers)
    { "serverCommand": ["npx", "-y", "unapproved-package"] },

    // Block by URL pattern (for remote servers)
    { "serverUrl": "https://*.untrusted.com/*" }
  ]
}
```

#### How command-based restrictions work

**Exact matching**:

* Command arrays must match **exactly** - both the command and all arguments in the correct order
* Example: `["npx", "-y", "server"]` will NOT match `["npx", "server"]` or `["npx", "-y", "server", "--flag"]`

**Stdio server behavior**:

* When the allowlist contains **any** `serverCommand` entries, stdio servers **must** match one of those commands
* Stdio servers cannot pass by name alone when command restrictions are present
* This ensures administrators can enforce which commands are allowed to run

**Non-stdio server behavior**:

* Remote servers (HTTP, SSE, WebSocket) use URL-based matching when `serverUrl` entries exist in the allowlist
* If no URL entries exist, remote servers fall back to name-based matching
* Command restrictions do not apply to remote servers

#### How URL-based restrictions work

URL patterns support wildcards using `*` to match any sequence of characters. This is useful for allowing entire domains or subdomains.

**Wildcard examples**:

* `https://mcp.company.com/*` - Allow all paths on a specific domain
* `https://*.example.com/*` - Allow any subdomain of example.com
* `http://localhost:*/*` - Allow any port on localhost

**Remote server behavior**:

* When the allowlist contains **any** `serverUrl` entries, remote servers **must** match one of those URL patterns
* Remote servers cannot pass by name alone when URL restrictions are present
* This ensures administrators can enforce which remote endpoints are allowed

<Accordion title="Example: URL-only allowlist">
  ```json  theme={null}
  {
    "allowedMcpServers": [
      { "serverUrl": "https://mcp.company.com/*" },
      { "serverUrl": "https://*.internal.corp/*" }
    ]
  }
  ```

  **Result**:

  * HTTP server at `https://mcp.company.com/api`: ✅ Allowed (matches URL pattern)
  * HTTP server at `https://api.internal.corp/mcp`: ✅ Allowed (matches wildcard subdomain)
  * HTTP server at `https://external.com/mcp`: ❌ Blocked (doesn't match any URL pattern)
  * Stdio server with any command: ❌ Blocked (no name or command entries to match)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Example: Command-only allowlist">
  ```json  theme={null}
  {
    "allowedMcpServers": [
      { "serverCommand": ["npx", "-y", "approved-package"] }
    ]
  }
  ```

  **Result**:

  * Stdio server with `["npx", "-y", "approved-package"]`: ✅ Allowed (matches command)
  * Stdio server with `["node", "server.js"]`: ❌ Blocked (doesn't match command)
  * HTTP server named "my-api": ❌ Blocked (no name entries to match)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Example: Mixed name and command allowlist">
  ```json  theme={null}
  {
    "allowedMcpServers": [
      { "serverName": "github" },
      { "serverCommand": ["npx", "-y", "approved-package"] }
    ]
  }
  ```

  **Result**:

  * Stdio server named "local-tool" with `["npx", "-y", "approved-package"]`: ✅ Allowed (matches command)
  * Stdio server named "local-tool" with `["node", "server.js"]`: ❌ Blocked (command entries exist but doesn't match)
  * Stdio server named "github" with `["node", "server.js"]`: ❌ Blocked (stdio servers must match commands when command entries exist)
  * HTTP server named "github": ✅ Allowed (matches name)
  * HTTP server named "other-api": ❌ Blocked (name doesn't match)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Example: Name-only allowlist">
  ```json  theme={null}
  {
    "allowedMcpServers": [
      { "serverName": "github" },
      { "serverName": "internal-tool" }
    ]
  }
  ```

  **Result**:

  * Stdio server named "github" with any command: ✅ Allowed (no command restrictions)
  * Stdio server named "internal-tool" with any command: ✅ Allowed (no command restrictions)
  * HTTP server named "github": ✅ Allowed (matches name)
  * Any server named "other": ❌ Blocked (name doesn't match)
</Accordion>

#### Allowlist behavior (`allowedMcpServers`)

* `undefined` (default): No restrictions - users can configure any MCP server
* Empty array `[]`: Complete lockdown - users cannot configure any MCP servers
* List of entries: Users can only configure servers that match by name, command, or URL pattern

#### Denylist behavior (`deniedMcpServers`)

* `undefined` (default): No servers are blocked
* Empty array `[]`: No servers are blocked
* List of entries: Specified servers are explicitly blocked across all scopes

#### Important notes

* **Option 1 and Option 2 can be combined**: If `managed-mcp.json` exists, it has exclusive control and users cannot add servers. Allowlists/denylists still apply to the enterprise servers themselves.
* **Denylist takes absolute precedence**: If a server matches a denylist entry (by name, command, or URL), it will be blocked even if it's on the allowlist
* Name-based, command-based, and URL-based restrictions work together: a server passes if it matches **either** a name entry, a command entry, or a URL pattern (unless blocked by denylist)

<Note>
  **When using `managed-mcp.json`**: Users cannot add MCP servers through `claude mcp add` or configuration files. The `allowedMcpServers` and `deniedMcpServers` settings still apply to filter which enterprise servers are actually loaded.
</Note>

# Troubleshooting

> Discover solutions to common issues with Claude Code installation and usage.

## Common installation issues

### Windows installation issues: errors in WSL

You might encounter the following issues in WSL:

**OS/platform detection issues**: If you receive an error during installation, WSL may be using Windows `npm`. Try:

* Run `npm config set os linux` before installation
* Install with `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code --force --no-os-check` (Do NOT use `sudo`)

**Node not found errors**: If you see `exec: node: not found` when running `claude`, your WSL environment may be using a Windows installation of Node.js. You can confirm this with `which npm` and `which node`, which should point to Linux paths starting with `/usr/` rather than `/mnt/c/`. To fix this, try installing Node via your Linux distribution's package manager or via [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

**nvm version conflicts**: If you have nvm installed in both WSL and Windows, you may experience version conflicts when switching Node versions in WSL. This happens because WSL imports the Windows PATH by default, causing Windows nvm/npm to take priority over the WSL installation.

You can identify this issue by:

* Running `which npm` and `which node` - if they point to Windows paths (starting with `/mnt/c/`), Windows versions are being used
* Experiencing broken functionality after switching Node versions with nvm in WSL

To resolve this issue, fix your Linux PATH to ensure the Linux node/npm versions take priority:

**Primary solution: Ensure nvm is properly loaded in your shell**

The most common cause is that nvm isn't loaded in non-interactive shells. Add the following to your shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):

```bash  theme={null}
# Load nvm if it exists
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"
```

Or run directly in your current session:

```bash  theme={null}
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
```

**Alternative: Adjust PATH order**

If nvm is properly loaded but Windows paths still take priority, you can explicitly prepend your Linux paths to PATH in your shell configuration:

```bash  theme={null}
export PATH="$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/$(node -v)/bin:$PATH"
```

<Warning>
  Avoid disabling Windows PATH importing (`appendWindowsPath = false`) as this breaks the ability to call Windows executables from WSL. Similarly, avoid uninstalling Node.js from Windows if you use it for Windows development.
</Warning>

### Linux and Mac installation issues: permission or command not found errors

When installing Claude Code with npm, `PATH` problems may prevent access to `claude`.
You may also encounter permission errors if your npm global prefix is not user writable (for example, `/usr`, or `/usr/local`).

#### Recommended solution: Native Claude Code installation

Claude Code has a native installation that doesn't depend on npm or Node.js.

Use the following command to run the native installer.

**macOS, Linux, WSL:**

```bash  theme={null}
# Install stable version (default)
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash

# Install latest version
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash -s latest

# Install specific version number
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash -s 1.0.58
```

**Windows PowerShell:**

```powershell  theme={null}
# Install stable version (default)
irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex

# Install latest version
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1))) latest

# Install specific version number
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1))) 1.0.58

```

This command installs the appropriate build of Claude Code for your operating system and architecture and adds a symlink to the installation at `~/.local/bin/claude`.

<Tip>
  Make sure that you have the installation directory in your system PATH.
</Tip>

Verify installation:

```bash  theme={null}
claude doctor # Check installation health
```

## Permissions and authentication

### Repeated permission prompts

If you find yourself repeatedly approving the same commands, you can allow specific tools
to run without approval using the `/permissions` command. See [Permissions docs](/en/iam#configuring-permissions).

### Authentication issues

If you're experiencing authentication problems:

1. Run `/logout` to sign out completely
2. Close Claude Code
3. Restart with `claude` and complete the authentication process again

If problems persist, try:

```bash  theme={null}
rm -rf ~/.config/claude-code/auth.json
claude
```

This removes your stored authentication information and forces a clean login.

## Configuration file locations

Claude Code stores configuration in several locations:

| File                          | Purpose                                                                |
| :---------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `~/.claude/settings.json`     | User settings (permissions, hooks, model overrides)                    |
| `.claude/settings.json`       | Project settings (checked into source control)                         |
| `.claude/settings.local.json` | Local project settings (not committed)                                 |
| `~/.claude.json`              | Global state (theme, OAuth, MCP servers, allowed tools)                |
| `.mcp.json`                   | Project MCP servers (checked into source control)                      |
| `managed-settings.json`       | [Enterprise managed settings](/en/settings#settings-files)             |
| `managed-mcp.json`            | [Enterprise managed MCP servers](/en/mcp#enterprise-mcp-configuration) |

On Windows, `~` refers to your user home directory, such as `C:\Users\YourName`.

**Enterprise managed file locations:**

* macOS: `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/`
* Linux/WSL: `/etc/claude-code/`
* Windows: `C:\ProgramData\ClaudeCode\`

For details on configuring these files, see [Settings](/en/settings) and [MCP](/en/mcp).

### Resetting configuration

To reset Claude Code to default settings, you can remove the configuration files:

```bash  theme={null}
# Reset all user settings and state
rm ~/.claude.json
rm -rf ~/.claude/

# Reset project-specific settings
rm -rf .claude/
rm .mcp.json
```

<Warning>
  This will remove all your settings, allowed tools, MCP server configurations, and session history.
</Warning>

## Performance and stability

### High CPU or memory usage

Claude Code is designed to work with most development environments, but may consume significant resources when processing large codebases. If you're experiencing performance issues:

1. Use `/compact` regularly to reduce context size
2. Close and restart Claude Code between major tasks
3. Consider adding large build directories to your `.gitignore` file

### Command hangs or freezes

If Claude Code seems unresponsive:

1. Press Ctrl+C to attempt to cancel the current operation
2. If unresponsive, you may need to close the terminal and restart

### Search and discovery issues

If Search tool, `@file` mentions, custom agents, and custom slash commands aren't working, install system `ripgrep`:

```bash  theme={null}
# macOS (Homebrew)  
brew install ripgrep

# Windows (winget)
winget install BurntSushi.ripgrep.MSVC

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install ripgrep

# Alpine Linux
apk add ripgrep

# Arch Linux
pacman -S ripgrep
```

Then set `USE_BUILTIN_RIPGREP=0` in your [environment](/en/settings#environment-variables).

### Slow or incomplete search results on WSL

Disk read performance penalties when [working across file systems on WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/filesystems) may result in fewer-than-expected matches (but not a complete lack of search functionality) when using Claude Code on WSL.

<Note>
  `/doctor` will show Search as OK in this case.
</Note>

**Solutions:**

1. **Submit more specific searches**: Reduce the number of files searched by specifying directories or file types: "Search for JWT validation logic in the auth-service package" or "Find use of md5 hash in JS files".

2. **Move project to Linux filesystem**: If possible, ensure your project is located on the Linux filesystem (`/home/`) rather than the Windows filesystem (`/mnt/c/`).

3. **Use native Windows instead**: Consider running Claude Code natively on Windows instead of through WSL, for better file system performance.

## IDE integration issues

### JetBrains IDE not detected on WSL2

If you're using Claude Code on WSL2 with JetBrains IDEs and getting "No available IDEs detected" errors, this is likely due to WSL2's networking configuration or Windows Firewall blocking the connection.

#### WSL2 networking modes

WSL2 uses NAT networking by default, which can prevent IDE detection. You have two options:

**Option 1: Configure Windows Firewall** (recommended)

1. Find your WSL2 IP address:
   ```bash  theme={null}
   wsl hostname -I
   # Example output: 172.21.123.456
   ```

2. Open PowerShell as Administrator and create a firewall rule:
   ```powershell  theme={null}
   New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Allow WSL2 Internal Traffic" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -Action Allow -RemoteAddress 172.21.0.0/16 -LocalAddress 172.21.0.0/16
   ```
   (Adjust the IP range based on your WSL2 subnet from step 1)

3. Restart both your IDE and Claude Code

**Option 2: Switch to mirrored networking**

Add to `.wslconfig` in your Windows user directory:

```ini  theme={null}
[wsl2]
networkingMode=mirrored
```

Then restart WSL with `wsl --shutdown` from PowerShell.

<Note>
  These networking issues only affect WSL2. WSL1 uses the host's network directly and doesn't require these configurations.
</Note>

For additional JetBrains configuration tips, see our [JetBrains IDE guide](/en/jetbrains#plugin-settings).

### Reporting Windows IDE integration issues (both native and WSL)

If you're experiencing IDE integration problems on Windows, [create an issue](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues) with the following information:

* Environment type: native Windows (Git Bash) or WSL1/WSL2
* WSL networking mode (if applicable): NAT or mirrored
* IDE name and version
* Claude Code extension/plugin version
* Shell type: Bash, Zsh, PowerShell, etc.

### Escape key not working in JetBrains (IntelliJ, PyCharm, etc.) terminals

If you're using Claude Code in JetBrains terminals and the `Esc` key doesn't interrupt the agent as expected, this is likely due to a keybinding clash with JetBrains' default shortcuts.

To fix this issue:

1. Go to Settings → Tools → Terminal
2. Either:
   * Uncheck "Move focus to the editor with Escape", or
   * Click "Configure terminal keybindings" and delete the "Switch focus to Editor" shortcut
3. Apply the changes

This allows the `Esc` key to properly interrupt Claude Code operations.

## Markdown formatting issues

Claude Code sometimes generates markdown files with missing language tags on code fences, which can affect syntax highlighting and readability in GitHub, editors, and documentation tools.

### Missing language tags in code blocks

If you notice code blocks like this in generated markdown:

````markdown  theme={null}
```
function example() {
  return "hello";
}
```
````

Instead of properly tagged blocks like:

````markdown  theme={null}
```javascript
function example() {
  return "hello";
}
```
````

**Solutions:**

1. **Ask Claude to add language tags**: Request "Add appropriate language tags to all code blocks in this markdown file."

2. **Use post-processing hooks**: Set up automatic formatting hooks to detect and add missing language tags. See the [markdown formatting hook example](/en/hooks-guide#markdown-formatting-hook) for implementation details.

3. **Manual verification**: After generating markdown files, review them for proper code block formatting and request corrections if needed.

### Inconsistent spacing and formatting

If generated markdown has excessive blank lines or inconsistent spacing:

**Solutions:**

1. **Request formatting corrections**: Ask Claude to "Fix spacing and formatting issues in this markdown file."

2. **Use formatting tools**: Set up hooks to run markdown formatters like `prettier` or custom formatting scripts on generated markdown files.

3. **Specify formatting preferences**: Include formatting requirements in your prompts or project [memory](/en/memory) files.

### Best practices for markdown generation

To minimize formatting issues:

* **Be explicit in requests**: Ask for "properly formatted markdown with language-tagged code blocks"
* **Use project conventions**: Document your preferred markdown style in [`CLAUDE.md`](/en/memory)
* **Set up validation hooks**: Use post-processing hooks to automatically verify and fix common formatting issues

## Use specialized subagents

Suppose you want to use specialized AI subagents to handle specific tasks more effectively.

<Steps>
  <Step title="View available subagents">
    ```
    > /agents
    ```

    This shows all available subagents and lets you create new ones.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use subagents automatically">
    Claude Code automatically delegates appropriate tasks to specialized subagents:

    ```
    > review my recent code changes for security issues
    ```

    ```
    > run all tests and fix any failures
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Explicitly request specific subagents">
    ```
    > use the code-reviewer subagent to check the auth module
    ```

    ```
    > have the debugger subagent investigate why users can't log in
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create custom subagents for your workflow">
    ```
    > /agents
    ```

    Then select "Create New subagent" and follow the prompts to define:

    * A unique identifier that describes the subagent's purpose (for example, `code-reviewer`, `api-designer`).
    * When Claude should use this agent
    * Which tools it can access
    * A system prompt describing the agent's role and behavior
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

  * Create project-specific subagents in `.claude/agents/` for team sharing
  * Use descriptive `description` fields to enable automatic delegation
  * Limit tool access to what each subagent actually needs
  * Check the [subagents documentation](/en/sub-agents) for detailed examples
</Tip>

## Use Plan Mode for safe code analysis

Plan Mode instructs Claude to create a plan by analyzing the codebase with read-only operations, perfect for exploring codebases, planning complex changes, or reviewing code safely.

### When to use Plan Mode

* **Multi-step implementation**: When your feature requires making edits to many files
* **Code exploration**: When you want to research the codebase thoroughly before changing anything
* **Interactive development**: When you want to iterate on the direction with Claude

### How to use Plan Mode

**Turn on Plan Mode during a session**

You can switch into Plan Mode during a session using **Shift+Tab** to cycle through permission modes.

If you are in Normal Mode, **Shift+Tab** first switches into Auto-Accept Mode, indicated by `⏵⏵ accept edits on` at the bottom of the terminal. A subsequent **Shift+Tab** will switch into Plan Mode, indicated by `⏸ plan mode on`.

**Start a new session in Plan Mode**

To start a new session in Plan Mode, use the `--permission-mode plan` flag:

```bash  theme={null}
claude --permission-mode plan
```

**Run "headless" queries in Plan Mode**

You can also run a query in Plan Mode directly with `-p` (that is, in ["headless mode"](/en/headless)):

```bash  theme={null}
claude --permission-mode plan -p "Analyze the authentication system and suggest improvements"
```

### Example: Planning a complex refactor

```bash  theme={null}
claude --permission-mode plan
```

```
> I need to refactor our authentication system to use OAuth2. Create a detailed migration plan.
```

Claude analyzes the current implementation and create a comprehensive plan. Refine with follow-ups:

```
> What about backward compatibility?
> How should we handle database migration?
```

### Configure Plan Mode as default

```json  theme={null}
// .claude/settings.json
{
  "permissions": {
    "defaultMode": "plan"
  }
}
```

See [settings documentation](/en/settings#available-settings) for more configuration options.

***

## Work with tests

Suppose you need to add tests for uncovered code.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify untested code">
    ```
    > find functions in NotificationsService.swift that are not covered by tests 
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate test scaffolding">
    ```
    > add tests for the notification service 
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add meaningful test cases">
    ```
    > add test cases for edge conditions in the notification service 
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run and verify tests">
    ```
    > run the new tests and fix any failures 
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

Claude can generate tests that follow your project's existing patterns and conventions. When asking for tests, be specific about what behavior you want to verify. Claude examines your existing test files to match the style, frameworks, and assertion patterns already in use.

For comprehensive coverage, ask Claude to identify edge cases you might have missed. Claude can analyze your code paths and suggest tests for error conditions, boundary values, and unexpected inputs that are easy to overlook.

***

## Create pull requests

Suppose you need to create a well-documented pull request for your changes.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Summarize your changes">
    ```
    > summarize the changes I've made to the authentication module 
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate a pull request with Claude">
    ```
    > create a pr 
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and refine">
    ```
    > enhance the PR description with more context about the security improvements 
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add testing details">
    ```
    > add information about how these changes were tested 
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

  * Ask Claude directly to make a PR for you
  * Review Claude's generated PR before submitting
  * Ask Claude to highlight potential risks or considerations
</Tip>

## Handle documentation

Suppose you need to add or update documentation for your code.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify undocumented code">
    ```
    > find functions without proper JSDoc comments in the auth module 
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate documentation">
    ```
    > add JSDoc comments to the undocumented functions in auth.js 
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and enhance">
    ```
    > improve the generated documentation with more context and examples 
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify documentation">
    ```
    > check if the documentation follows our project standards 
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

  * Specify the documentation style you want (JSDoc, docstrings, etc.)
  * Ask for examples in the documentation
  * Request documentation for public APIs, interfaces, and complex logic
</Tip>

***

## Work with images

Suppose you need to work with images in your codebase, and you want Claude's help analyzing image content.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add an image to the conversation">
    You can use any of these methods:

    1. Drag and drop an image into the Claude Code window
    2. Copy an image and paste it into the CLI with ctrl+v (Do not use cmd+v)
    3. Provide an image path to Claude. E.g., "Analyze this image: /path/to/your/image.png"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Ask Claude to analyze the image">
    ```
    > What does this image show?
    ```

    ```
    > Describe the UI elements in this screenshot
    ```

    ```
    > Are there any problematic elements in this diagram?
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use images for context">
    ```
    > Here's a screenshot of the error. What's causing it?
    ```

    ```
    > This is our current database schema. How should we modify it for the new feature?
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get code suggestions from visual content">
    ```
    > Generate CSS to match this design mockup
    ```

    ```
    > What HTML structure would recreate this component?
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

  * Use images when text descriptions would be unclear or cumbersome
  * Include screenshots of errors, UI designs, or diagrams for better context
  * You can work with multiple images in a conversation
  * Image analysis works with diagrams, screenshots, mockups, and more
</Tip>

***

## Reference files and directories

Use @ to quickly include files or directories without waiting for Claude to read them.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Reference a single file">
    ```
    > Explain the logic in @src/utils/auth.js
    ```

    This includes the full content of the file in the conversation.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Reference a directory">
    ```
    > What's the structure of @src/components?
    ```

    This provides a directory listing with file information.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Reference MCP resources">
    ```
    > Show me the data from @github:repos/owner/repo/issues
    ```

    This fetches data from connected MCP servers using the format @server:resource. See [MCP resources](/en/mcp#use-mcp-resources) for details.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

  * File paths can be relative or absolute
  * @ file references add `CLAUDE.md` in the file's directory and parent directories to context
  * Directory references show file listings, not contents
  * You can reference multiple files in a single message (for example, "@file1.js and @file2.js")
</Tip>

***

## Use extended thinking (thinking mode)

[Extended thinking](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking) reserves a portion of the total output token budget for Claude to reason through complex problems step-by-step. This reasoning is visible in verbose mode, which you can toggle on with `Ctrl+O`.

Extended thinking is particularly valuable for complex architectural decisions, challenging bugs, multi-step implementation planning, and evaluating tradeoffs between different approaches. It provides more space for exploring multiple solutions, analyzing edge cases, and self-correcting mistakes.

<Note>
  Sonnet 4.5 and Opus 4.5 have thinking enabled by default. All other models have thinking disabled by default. Use `/model` to view or switch your current model.
</Note>

You can configure thinking mode for Claude Code in two ways:

| Scope                             | How to enable                                                                        | Details                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Global default**                | Use `/config` to toggle thinking mode on                                             | Sets your default across all projects.<br />Saved as `alwaysThinkingEnabled` in `~/.claude/settings.json`                                        |
| **Environment variable override** | Set [`MAX_THINKING_TOKENS`](/en/settings#environment-variables) environment variable | When set, applies a custom token budget to all requests, overriding your thinking mode configuration. Example: `export MAX_THINKING_TOKENS=1024` |

### Per-request thinking with `ultrathink`

You can include `ultrathink` as a keyword in your message to enable thinking for a single request:

```
> ultrathink: design a caching layer for our API
```

Note that `ultrathink` both allocates the thinking budget AND semantically signals to Claude to reason more thoroughly, which may result in deeper thinking than necessary for your task.

The `ultrathink` keyword only works when `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS` is not set. When `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS` is configured, it takes priority and controls the thinking budget for all requests.

Other phrases like "think", "think hard", and "think more" are interpreted as regular prompt instructions and don't allocate thinking tokens.

To view Claude's thinking process, press `Ctrl+O` to toggle verbose mode and see the internal reasoning displayed as gray italic text.

See the [token budget section below](#how-extended-thinking-token-budgets-work) for detailed budget information and cost implications.

### How extended thinking token budgets work

Extended thinking uses a **token budget** that controls how much internal reasoning Claude can perform before responding.

A larger thinking token budget provides:

* More space to explore multiple solution approaches step-by-step
* Room to analyze edge cases and evaluate tradeoffs thoroughly
* Ability to revise reasoning and self-correct mistakes

Token budgets for thinking mode:

* When thinking is **enabled** (via `/config` or `ultrathink`), Claude can use up to **31,999 tokens** from your output budget for internal reasoning
* When thinking is **disabled**, Claude uses **0 tokens** for thinking

**Custom token budgets:**

* You can set a custom thinking token budget using the [`MAX_THINKING_TOKENS` environment variable](/en/settings#environment-variables)
* This takes highest priority and overrides the default 31,999 token budget
* See the [extended thinking documentation](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking) for valid token ranges

<Warning>
  You're charged for all thinking tokens used, even though Claude 4 models show summarized thinking
</Warning>

***

## Resume previous conversations

When starting Claude Code, you can resume a previous session:

* `claude --continue` continues the most recent conversation in the current directory
* `claude --resume` opens a conversation picker or resumes by name

From inside an active session, use `/resume` to switch to a different conversation.

Sessions are stored per project directory. The `/resume` picker shows sessions from the same git repository, including worktrees.

### Name your sessions

Give sessions descriptive names to find them later. This is a best practice when working on multiple tasks or features.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Name the current session">
    Use `/rename` during a session to give it a memorable name:

    ```
    > /rename auth-refactor
    ```

    You can also rename any session from the picker: run `/resume`, navigate to a session, and press `R`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Resume by name later">
    From the command line:

    ```bash  theme={null}
    claude --resume auth-refactor
    ```

    Or from inside an active session:

    ```
    > /resume auth-refactor
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Use the session picker

The `/resume` command (or `claude --resume` without arguments) opens an interactive session picker with these features:

**Keyboard shortcuts in the picker:**

| Shortcut  | Action                                            |
| :-------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| `↑` / `↓` | Navigate between sessions                         |
| `→` / `←` | Expand or collapse grouped sessions               |
| `Enter`   | Select and resume the highlighted session         |
| `P`       | Preview the session content                       |
| `R`       | Rename the highlighted session                    |
| `/`       | Search to filter sessions                         |
| `A`       | Toggle between current directory and all projects |
| `B`       | Filter to sessions from your current git branch   |
| `Esc`     | Exit the picker or search mode                    |

**Session organization:**

The picker displays sessions with helpful metadata:

* Session name or initial prompt
* Time elapsed since last activity
* Message count
* Git branch (if applicable)

Forked sessions (created with `/rewind` or `--fork-session`) are grouped together under their root session, making it easier to find related conversations.

<Tip>
  Tips:

  * **Name sessions early**: Use `/rename` when starting work on a distinct task—it's much easier to find "payment-integration" than "explain this function" later
  * Use `--continue` for quick access to your most recent conversation
  * Use `--resume session-name` when you know which session you need
  * Use `--resume` (without a name) when you need to browse and select
  * For scripts, use `claude --continue --print "prompt"` to resume in non-interactive mode
  * Press `P` in the picker to preview a session before resuming it
  * The resumed conversation starts with the same model and configuration as the original

  How it works:

  1. **Conversation Storage**: All conversations are automatically saved locally with their full message history
  2. **Message Deserialization**: When resuming, the entire message history is restored to maintain context
  3. **Tool State**: Tool usage and results from the previous conversation are preserved
  4. **Context Restoration**: The conversation resumes with all previous context intact
</Tip>

## Run parallel Claude Code sessions with Git worktrees

Suppose you need to work on multiple tasks simultaneously with complete code isolation between Claude Code instances.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Understand Git worktrees">
    Git worktrees allow you to check out multiple branches from the same
    repository into separate directories. Each worktree has its own working
    directory with isolated files, while sharing the same Git history. Learn
    more in the [official Git worktree
    documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a new worktree">
    ```bash  theme={null}
    # Create a new worktree with a new branch 
    git worktree add ../project-feature-a -b feature-a

    # Or create a worktree with an existing branch
    git worktree add ../project-bugfix bugfix-123
    ```

    This creates a new directory with a separate working copy of your repository.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Claude Code in each worktree">
    ```bash  theme={null}
    # Navigate to your worktree 
    cd ../project-feature-a

    # Run Claude Code in this isolated environment
    claude
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Claude in another worktree">
    ```bash  theme={null}
    cd ../project-bugfix
    claude
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Manage your worktrees">
    ```bash  theme={null}
    # List all worktrees
    git worktree list

    # Remove a worktree when done
    git worktree remove ../project-feature-a
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

  * Each worktree has its own independent file state, making it perfect for parallel Claude Code sessions
  * Changes made in one worktree won't affect others, preventing Claude instances from interfering with each other
  * All worktrees share the same Git history and remote connections
  * For long-running tasks, you can have Claude working in one worktree while you continue development in another
  * Use descriptive directory names to easily identify which task each worktree is for
  * Remember to initialize your development environment in each new worktree according to your project's setup. Depending on your stack, this might include:
    * JavaScript projects: Running dependency installation (`npm install`, `yarn`)
    * Python projects: Setting up virtual environments or installing with package managers
    * Other languages: Following your project's standard setup process
</Tip>

***

## Use Claude as a unix-style utility

### Add Claude to your verification process

Suppose you want to use Claude Code as a linter or code reviewer.

**Add Claude to your build script:**

```json  theme={null}
// package.json
{
    ...
    "scripts": {
        ...
        "lint:claude": "claude -p 'you are a linter. please look at the changes vs. main and report any issues related to typos. report the filename and line number on one line, and a description of the issue on the second line. do not return any other text.'"
    }
}
```

<Tip>
  Tips:

  * Use Claude for automated code review in your CI/CD pipeline
  * Customize the prompt to check for specific issues relevant to your project
  * Consider creating multiple scripts for different types of verification
</Tip>

### Pipe in, pipe out

Suppose you want to pipe data into Claude, and get back data in a structured format.

**Pipe data through Claude:**

```bash  theme={null}
cat build-error.txt | claude -p 'concisely explain the root cause of this build error' > output.txt
```

<Tip>
  Tips:

  * Use pipes to integrate Claude into existing shell scripts
  * Combine with other Unix tools for powerful workflows
  * Consider using --output-format for structured output
</Tip>

### Control output format

Suppose you need Claude's output in a specific format, especially when integrating Claude Code into scripts or other tools.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use text format (default)">
    ```bash  theme={null}
    cat data.txt | claude -p 'summarize this data' --output-format text > summary.txt
    ```

    This outputs just Claude's plain text response (default behavior).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use JSON format">
    ```bash  theme={null}
    cat code.py | claude -p 'analyze this code for bugs' --output-format json > analysis.json
    ```

    This outputs a JSON array of messages with metadata including cost and duration.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use streaming JSON format">
    ```bash  theme={null}
    cat log.txt | claude -p 'parse this log file for errors' --output-format stream-json
    ```

    This outputs a series of JSON objects in real-time as Claude processes the request. Each message is a valid JSON object, but the entire output is not valid JSON if concatenated.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

  * Use `--output-format text` for simple integrations where you just need Claude's response
  * Use `--output-format json` when you need the full conversation log
  * Use `--output-format stream-json` for real-time output of each conversation turn
</Tip>

## Create custom slash commands

Claude Code supports custom slash commands that you can create to quickly execute specific prompts or tasks.

For more details, see the [Slash commands](/en/slash-commands) reference page.

### Create project-specific commands

Suppose you want to create reusable slash commands for your project that all team members can use.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a commands directory in your project">
    ```bash  theme={null}
    mkdir -p .claude/commands
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Markdown file for each command">
    ```bash  theme={null}
    echo "Analyze the performance of this code and suggest three specific optimizations:" > .claude/commands/optimize.md 
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use your custom command in Claude Code">
    ```
    > /optimize 
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

  * Command names are derived from the filename (for example, `optimize.md` becomes `/optimize`)
  * You can organize commands in subdirectories (for example, `.claude/commands/frontend/component.md` creates `/component` with "(project:frontend)" shown in the description)
  * Project commands are available to everyone who clones the repository
  * The Markdown file content becomes the prompt sent to Claude when the command is invoked
</Tip>

### Add command arguments with \$ARGUMENTS

Suppose you want to create flexible slash commands that can accept additional input from users.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a command file with the $ARGUMENTS placeholder">
    ```bash  theme={null}
    echo 'Find and fix issue #$ARGUMENTS. Follow these steps: 1.
    Understand the issue described in the ticket 2. Locate the relevant code in
    our codebase 3. Implement a solution that addresses the root cause 4. Add
    appropriate tests 5. Prepare a concise PR description' >
    .claude/commands/fix-issue.md 
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use the command with an issue number">
    In your Claude session, use the command with arguments.

    ```
    > /fix-issue 123 
    ```

    This replaces \$ARGUMENTS with "123" in the prompt.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

  * The \$ARGUMENTS placeholder is replaced with any text that follows the command
  * You can position \$ARGUMENTS anywhere in your command template
  * Other useful applications: generating test cases for specific functions, creating documentation for components, reviewing code in particular files, or translating content to specified languages
</Tip>

### Create personal slash commands

Suppose you want to create personal slash commands that work across all your projects.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a commands directory in your home folder">
    ```bash  theme={null}
    mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands 
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Markdown file for each command">
    ```bash  theme={null}
    echo "Review this code for security vulnerabilities, focusing on:" >
    ~/.claude/commands/security-review.md 
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use your personal custom command">
    ```
    > /security-review 
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Tips:

  * Personal commands show "(user)" in their description when listed with `/help`
  * Personal commands are only available to you and not shared with your team
  * Personal commands work across all your projects
  * You can use these for consistent workflows across different codebases
</Tip>

# Claude Code settings

> Configure Claude Code with global and project-level settings, and environment variables.

Claude Code offers a variety of settings to configure its behavior to meet your needs. You can configure Claude Code by running the `/config` command when using the interactive REPL, which opens a tabbed Settings interface where you can view status information and modify configuration options.

## Configuration scopes

Claude Code uses a **scope system** to determine where configurations apply and who they're shared with. Understanding scopes helps you decide how to configure Claude Code for personal use, team collaboration, or enterprise deployment.

### Available scopes

| Scope          | Location                             | Who it affects                       | Shared with team?      |
| :------------- | :----------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- | :--------------------- |
| **Enterprise** | System-level `managed-settings.json` | All users on the machine             | Yes (deployed by IT)   |
| **User**       | `~/.claude/` directory               | You, across all projects             | No                     |
| **Project**    | `.claude/` in repository             | All collaborators on this repository | Yes (committed to git) |
| **Local**      | `.claude/*.local.*` files            | You, in this repository only         | No (gitignored)        |

### When to use each scope

**Enterprise scope** is for:

* Security policies that must be enforced organization-wide
* Compliance requirements that can't be overridden
* Standardized configurations deployed by IT/DevOps

**User scope** is best for:

* Personal preferences you want everywhere (themes, editor settings)
* Tools and plugins you use across all projects
* API keys and authentication (stored securely)

**Project scope** is best for:

* Team-shared settings (permissions, hooks, MCP servers)
* Plugins the whole team should have
* Standardizing tooling across collaborators

**Local scope** is best for:

* Personal overrides for a specific project
* Testing configurations before sharing with the team
* Machine-specific settings that won't work for others

### How scopes interact

When the same setting is configured in multiple scopes, more specific scopes take precedence:

1. **Enterprise** (highest) - can't be overridden by anything
2. **Command line arguments** - temporary session overrides
3. **Local** - overrides project and user settings
4. **Project** - overrides user settings
5. **User** (lowest) - applies when nothing else specifies the setting

For example, if a permission is allowed in user settings but denied in project settings, the project setting takes precedence and the permission is blocked.

### What uses scopes

Scopes apply to many Claude Code features:

| Feature         | User location             | Project location                   | Local location                 |
| :-------------- | :------------------------ | :--------------------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| **Settings**    | `~/.claude/settings.json` | `.claude/settings.json`            | `.claude/settings.local.json`  |
| **Subagents**   | `~/.claude/agents/`       | `.claude/agents/`                  | —                              |
| **MCP servers** | `~/.claude.json`          | `.mcp.json`                        | `~/.claude.json` (per-project) |
| **Plugins**     | `~/.claude/settings.json` | `.claude/settings.json`            | `.claude/settings.local.json`  |
| **CLAUDE.md**   | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`     | `CLAUDE.md` or `.claude/CLAUDE.md` | `CLAUDE.local.md`              |

***

## Settings files

The `settings.json` file is our official mechanism for configuring Claude
Code through hierarchical settings:

* **User settings** are defined in `~/.claude/settings.json` and apply to all
  projects.
* **Project settings** are saved in your project directory:
  * `.claude/settings.json` for settings that are checked into source control and shared with your team
  * `.claude/settings.local.json` for settings that are not checked in, useful for personal preferences and experimentation. Claude Code will configure git to ignore `.claude/settings.local.json` when it is created.
* **Managed settings** (Enterprise): Enterprise administrators can configure and distribute Claude Code settings to their organization through the [Claude.ai admin console](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/claude-code). These settings are fetched automatically when users authenticate, take precedence over user and project settings, and cannot be overridden locally. This feature is available to Claude for Enterprise customers. If you don't see this option in your admin console, contact your Anthropic account team to have the feature enabled.

  For organizations that prefer file-based policy distribution, Claude Code also supports `managed-settings.json` and `managed-mcp.json` files that can be deployed to system directories:

  * macOS: `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/`
  * Linux and WSL: `/etc/claude-code/`
  * Windows: `C:\Program Files\ClaudeCode\`

  <Note>
    These are system-wide paths (not user home directories like `~/Library/...`) that require administrator privileges. They are designed to be deployed by IT administrators.
  </Note>

  See [Enterprise managed settings](/en/iam#enterprise-managed-settings) and [Enterprise MCP configuration](/en/mcp#enterprise-mcp-configuration) for details.

  <Note>
    Enterprise deployments can also restrict **plugin marketplace additions** using
    `strictKnownMarketplaces`. For more information, see [Enterprise marketplace restrictions](/en/plugin-marketplaces#enterprise-marketplace-restrictions).
  </Note>
* **Other configuration** is stored in `~/.claude.json`. This file contains your preferences (theme, notification settings, editor mode), OAuth session, [MCP server](/en/mcp) configurations for user and local scopes, per-project state (allowed tools, trust settings), and various caches. Project-scoped MCP servers are stored separately in `.mcp.json`.

```JSON Example settings.json theme={null}

  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(npm run lint)",
      "Bash(npm run test:*)",
      "Read(~/.zshrc)"

### Sandbox settings

Configure advanced sandboxing behavior. Sandboxing isolates bash commands from your filesystem and network. See [Sandboxing](/en/sandboxing) for details.

**Filesystem and network restrictions** are configured via Read, Edit, and WebFetch permission rules, not via these sandbox settings.

| Keys                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Example                   |

| `enableWeakerNestedSandbox` | Enable weaker sandbox for unprivileged Docker environments (Linux only). **Reduces security.** Default: false                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | `true`                    |

**Configuration example:**

```json  theme={null}
{
  "sandbox": {
    "enabled": true,
    "autoAllowBashIfSandboxed": true,
    "excludedCommands": ["docker"],
    "network": {
      "allowUnixSockets": [
        "/var/run/docker.sock"
      ],
      "allowLocalBinding": true
    }
  },
  "permissions": {
    "deny": [
      "Read(.envrc)",
      "Read(~/.aws/**)"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Filesystem and network restrictions** use standard permission rules:

* Use `Read` deny rules to block Claude from reading specific files or directories
* Use `Edit` allow rules to let Claude write to directories beyond the current working directory
* Use `Edit` deny rules to block writes to specific paths
* Use `WebFetch` allow/deny rules to control which network domains Claude can access

### Attribution settings

Claude Code adds attribution to git commits and pull requests. These are configured separately:

* Commits use [git trailers](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-interpret-trailers) (like `Co-Authored-By`) by default,  which can be customized or disabled
* Pull request descriptions are plain text

| Keys     | Description                                                                                |
| :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `commit` | Attribution for git commits, including any trailers. Empty string hides commit attribution |
| `pr`     | Attribution for pull request descriptions. Empty string hides pull request attribution     |

**Default commit attribution:**

```
🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

   Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

**Default pull request attribution:**

```
🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
```

**Example:**

```json  theme={null}
{
  "attribution": {
    "commit": "Generated with AI\n\nCo-Authored-By: AI <ai@example.com>",
    "pr": ""
  }
}
```

<Note>
  The `attribution` setting takes precedence over the deprecated `includeCoAuthoredBy` setting. To hide all attribution, set `commit` and `pr` to empty strings.
</Note>

### File suggestion settings

Configure a custom command for `@` file path autocomplete. The built-in file suggestion uses fast filesystem traversal, but large monorepos may benefit from project-specific indexing such as a pre-built file index or custom tooling.

```json  theme={null}
{
  "fileSuggestion": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "~/.claude/file-suggestion.sh"
  }
}
```

The command runs with the same environment variables as [hooks](/en/hooks), including `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`. It receives JSON via stdin with a `query` field:

```json  theme={null}
{"query": "src/comp"}
```

Output newline-separated file paths to stdout (currently limited to 15):

```
src/components/Button.tsx
src/components/Modal.tsx
src/components/Form.tsx
```

**Example:**

```bash  theme={null}
#!/bin/bash
query=$(cat | jq -r '.query')
your-repo-file-index --query "$query" | head -20
```

### Hook configuration

**Enterprise-only setting**: Controls which hooks are allowed to run. This setting can only be configured in [managed settings](#settings-files) and provides enterprise administrators with strict control over hook execution.

**Behavior when `allowManagedHooksOnly` is `true`:**

* Managed hooks and SDK hooks are loaded
* User hooks, project hooks, and plugin hooks are blocked

**Configuration:**

```json  theme={null}
{
  "allowManagedHooksOnly": true
}
```

### Settings precedence

Settings apply in order of precedence. From highest to lowest:

1. **Managed settings** (Enterprise)
   * Remote settings configured via the [Claude.ai admin console](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/claude-code)
   * Fetched automatically when users authenticate
   * Cannot be overridden

2. **File-based managed settings** (`managed-settings.json`)
   * Policies deployed by IT/DevOps to system directories
   * Cannot be overridden by user or project settings
   * Ignored when remote managed settings are configured

3. **Command line arguments**
   * Temporary overrides for a specific session

4. **Local project settings** (`.claude/settings.local.json`)
   * Personal project-specific settings

5. **Shared project settings** (`.claude/settings.json`)
   * Team-shared project settings in source control

6. **User settings** (`~/.claude/settings.json`)
   * Personal global settings

This hierarchy ensures that enterprise security policies are always enforced while still allowing teams and individuals to customize their experience.

For example, if your user settings allow `Bash(npm run:*)` but a project's shared settings deny it, the project setting takes precedence and the command is blocked.

### Key points about the configuration system

* **Memory files (`CLAUDE.md`)**: Contain instructions and context that Claude loads at startup
* **Settings files (JSON)**: Configure permissions, environment variables, and tool behavior
* **Slash commands**: Custom commands that can be invoked during a session with `/command-name`
* **MCP servers**: Extend Claude Code with additional tools and integrations
* **Precedence**: Higher-level configurations (Enterprise) override lower-level ones (User/Project)
* **Inheritance**: Settings are merged, with more specific settings adding to or overriding broader ones

### System prompt

Claude Code's internal system prompt is not published. To add custom instructions, use `CLAUDE.md` files or the `--append-system-prompt` flag.

### Excluding sensitive files

To prevent Claude Code from accessing files containing sensitive information like API keys, secrets, and environment files, use the `permissions.deny` setting in your `.claude/settings.json` file:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "permissions": {
    "deny": [
      "Read(./.env)",
      "Read(./.env.*)",
      "Read(./secrets/**)",
      "Read(./config/credentials.json)",
      "Read(./build)"
    ]
  }
}
```

This replaces the deprecated `ignorePatterns` configuration. Files matching these patterns will be completely invisible to Claude Code, preventing any accidental exposure of sensitive data.

## Subagent configuration

Claude Code supports custom AI subagents that can be configured at both user and project levels. These subagents are stored as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter:

* **User subagents**: `~/.claude/agents/` - Available across all your projects
* **Project subagents**: `.claude/agents/` - Specific to your project and can be shared with your team

Subagent files define specialized AI assistants with custom prompts and tool permissions. Learn more about creating and using subagents in the [subagents documentation](/en/sub-agents).

## Plugin configuration

Claude Code supports a plugin system that lets you extend functionality with custom commands, agents, hooks, and MCP servers. Plugins are distributed through marketplaces and can be configured at both user and repository levels.

### Plugin settings

Plugin-related settings in `settings.json`:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "formatter@acme-tools": true,
    "deployer@acme-tools": true,
    "analyzer@security-plugins": false
  },
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "acme-tools": {
      "source": "github",
      "repo": "acme-corp/claude-plugins"
    }
  }
}
```

#### `enabledPlugins`

Controls which plugins are enabled. Format: `"plugin-name@marketplace-name": true/false`

**Scopes**:

* **User settings** (`~/.claude/settings.json`): Personal plugin preferences
* **Project settings** (`.claude/settings.json`): Project-specific plugins shared with team
* **Local settings** (`.claude/settings.local.json`): Per-machine overrides (not committed)

**Example**:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "code-formatter@team-tools": true,
    "deployment-tools@team-tools": true,
    "experimental-features@personal": false
  }
}
```

#### `extraKnownMarketplaces`

Defines additional marketplaces that should be made available for the repository. Typically used in repository-level settings to ensure team members have access to required plugin sources.

**When a repository includes `extraKnownMarketplaces`**:

1. Team members are prompted to install the marketplace when they trust the folder
2. Team members are then prompted to install plugins from that marketplace
3. Users can skip unwanted marketplaces or plugins (stored in user settings)
4. Installation respects trust boundaries and requires explicit consent

**Example**:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "acme-tools": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "acme-corp/claude-plugins"
      }
    },
    "security-plugins": {
      "source": {
        "source": "git",
        "url": "https://git.example.com/security/plugins.git"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Marketplace source types**:

* `github`: GitHub repository (uses `repo`)
* `git`: Any git URL (uses `url`)
* `directory`: Local filesystem path (uses `path`, for development only)

#### `strictKnownMarketplaces`

**Enterprise-only setting**: Controls which plugin marketplaces users are allowed to add. This setting can only be configured in [`managed-settings.json`](/en/iam#enterprise-managed-settings) and provides enterprise administrators with strict control over marketplace sources.

**Managed settings file locations**:

* **macOS**: `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json`
* **Linux and WSL**: `/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json`
* **Windows**: `C:\ProgramData\ClaudeCode\managed-settings.json`

**Key characteristics**:

* Only available in enterprise managed settings (`managed-settings.json`)
* Cannot be overridden by user or project settings (highest precedence)
* Enforced BEFORE network/filesystem operations (blocked sources never execute)
* Uses exact matching for source specifications (including `ref`, `path` for git sources)

**Allowlist behavior**:

* `undefined` (default): No restrictions - users can add any marketplace
* Empty array `[]`: Complete lockdown - users cannot add any new marketplaces
* List of sources: Users can only add marketplaces that match exactly

**All supported source types**:

The allowlist supports six marketplace source types. Each source must match exactly for a user's marketplace addition to be allowed.

1. **GitHub repositories**:

```json  theme={null}
{ "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/approved-plugins" }
{ "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/security-tools", "ref": "v2.0" }
{ "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/plugins", "ref": "main", "path": "marketplace" }
```

Fields: `repo` (required), `ref` (optional: branch/tag/SHA), `path` (optional: subdirectory)

2. **Git repositories**:

```json  theme={null}
{ "source": "git", "url": "https://gitlab.example.com/tools/plugins.git" }
{ "source": "git", "url": "https://bitbucket.org/acme-corp/plugins.git", "ref": "production" }
{ "source": "git", "url": "ssh://git@git.example.com/plugins.git", "ref": "v3.1", "path": "approved" }
```

Fields: `url` (required), `ref` (optional: branch/tag/SHA), `path` (optional: subdirectory)

3. **URL-based marketplaces**:

```json  theme={null}
{ "source": "url", "url": "https://plugins.example.com/marketplace.json" }
{ "source": "url", "url": "https://cdn.example.com/marketplace.json", "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ${TOKEN}" } }
```

Fields: `url` (required), `headers` (optional: HTTP headers for authenticated access)

4. **NPM packages**:

```json  theme={null}
{ "source": "npm", "package": "@acme-corp/claude-plugins" }
{ "source": "npm", "package": "@acme-corp/approved-marketplace" }
```

Fields: `package` (required, supports scoped packages)

5. **File paths**:

```json  theme={null}
{ "source": "file", "path": "/usr/local/share/claude/acme-marketplace.json" }
{ "source": "file", "path": "/opt/acme-corp/plugins/marketplace.json" }
```

Fields: `path` (required: absolute path to marketplace.json file)

6. **Directory paths**:

```json  theme={null}
{ "source": "directory", "path": "/usr/local/share/claude/acme-plugins" }
{ "source": "directory", "path": "/opt/acme-corp/approved-marketplaces" }
```

Fields: `path` (required: absolute path to directory containing `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`)

**Configuration examples**:

Example - Allow specific marketplaces only:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "strictKnownMarketplaces": [
    {
      "source": "github",
      "repo": "acme-corp/approved-plugins"
    },
    {
      "source": "github",
      "repo": "acme-corp/security-tools",
      "ref": "v2.0"
    },
    {
      "source": "url",
      "url": "https://plugins.example.com/marketplace.json"
    },
    {
      "source": "npm",
      "package": "@acme-corp/compliance-plugins"
    }
  ]
}
```

Example - Disable all marketplace additions:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "strictKnownMarketplaces": []
}
```

**Exact matching requirements**:

Marketplace sources must match **exactly** for a user's addition to be allowed. For git-based sources (`github` and `git`), this includes all optional fields:

* The `repo` or `url` must match exactly
* The `ref` field must match exactly (or both be undefined)
* The `path` field must match exactly (or both be undefined)

Examples of sources that **do NOT match**:

```json  theme={null}
// These are DIFFERENT sources:
{ "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/plugins" }
{ "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/plugins", "ref": "main" }

// These are also DIFFERENT:
{ "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/plugins", "path": "marketplace" }
{ "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/plugins" }
```

**Comparison with `extraKnownMarketplaces`**:

| Aspect                | `strictKnownMarketplaces`            | `extraKnownMarketplaces`             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| **Purpose**           | Enterprise policy enforcement        | Team convenience                     |
| **Settings file**     | `managed-settings.json` only         | Any settings file                    |
| **Behavior**          | Blocks non-allowlisted additions     | Auto-installs missing marketplaces   |
| **When enforced**     | Before network/filesystem operations | After user trust prompt              |
| **Can be overridden** | No (highest precedence)              | Yes (by higher precedence settings)  |
| **Source format**     | Direct source object                 | Named marketplace with nested source |
| **Use case**          | Compliance, security restrictions    | Onboarding, standardization          |

**Format difference**:

`strictKnownMarketplaces` uses direct source objects:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "strictKnownMarketplaces": [
    { "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/plugins" }
  ]
}
```

`extraKnownMarketplaces` requires named marketplaces:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "acme-tools": {
      "source": { "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/plugins" }
    }
  }
}
```

**Important notes**:

* Restrictions are checked BEFORE any network requests or filesystem operations
* When blocked, users see clear error messages indicating the source is blocked by enterprise policy
* The restriction applies only to adding NEW marketplaces; previously installed marketplaces remain accessible
* Enterprise managed settings have the highest precedence and cannot be overridden

See [Enterprise marketplace restrictions](/en/plugin-marketplaces#enterprise-marketplace-restrictions) for user-facing documentation.

### Managing plugins

Use the `/plugin` command to manage plugins interactively:

* Browse available plugins from marketplaces
* Install/uninstall plugins
* Enable/disable plugins
* View plugin details (commands, agents, hooks provided)
* Add/remove marketplaces

Learn more about the plugin system in the [plugins documentation](/en/plugins).

## Environment variables

Claude Code supports the following environment variables to control its behavior:

<Note>
  All environment variables can also be configured in [`settings.json`](#available-settings). This is useful as a way to automatically set environment variables for each session, or to roll out a set of environment variables for your whole team or organization.
</Note>

Permission rules can be configured using `/allowed-tools` or in [permission settings](/en/settings#available-settings). Also see [Tool-specific permission rules](/en/iam#tool-specific-permission-rules).

### Bash tool behavior

The Bash tool executes shell commands with the following persistence behavior:

* **Working directory persists**: When Claude changes the working directory (for example, `cd /path/to/dir`), subsequent Bash commands will execute in that directory. You can use `CLAUDE_BASH_MAINTAIN_PROJECT_WORKING_DIR=1` to reset to the project directory after each command.
* **Environment variables do NOT persist**: Environment variables set in one Bash command (for example, `export MY_VAR=value`) are **not** available in subsequent Bash commands. Each Bash command runs in a fresh shell environment.

To make environment variables available in Bash commands, you have **three options**:

**Option 1: Activate environment before starting Claude Code** (simplest approach)

Activate your virtual environment in your terminal before launching Claude Code:

```bash  theme={null}
conda activate myenv
# or: source /path/to/venv/bin/activate
claude
```

This works for shell environments but environment variables set within Claude's Bash commands will not persist between commands.

**Option 2: Set CLAUDE\_ENV\_FILE before starting Claude Code** (persistent environment setup)

Export the path to a shell script containing your environment setup:

```bash  theme={null}
export CLAUDE_ENV_FILE=/path/to/env-setup.sh
claude
```

Where `/path/to/env-setup.sh` contains:

```bash  theme={null}
conda activate myenv
# or: source /path/to/venv/bin/activate
# or: export MY_VAR=value
```

Claude Code will source this file before each Bash command, making the environment persistent across all commands.

**Option 3: Use a SessionStart hook** (project-specific configuration)

Configure in `.claude/settings.json`:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [{
      "matcher": "startup",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "echo 'conda activate myenv' >> \"$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE\""
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

The hook writes to `$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE`, which is then sourced before each Bash command. This is ideal for team-shared project configurations.

See [SessionStart hooks](/en/hooks#persisting-environment-variables) for more details on Option 3.

### Extending tools with hooks

You can run custom commands before or after any tool executes using
[Claude Code hooks](/en/hooks-guide).

For example, you could automatically run a Python formatter after Claude
modifies Python files, or prevent modifications to production configuration
files by blocking Write operations to certain paths.

# Optimize your terminal setup

> Claude Code works best when your terminal is properly configured. Follow these guidelines to optimize your experience.

### Themes and appearance

Claude cannot control the theme of your terminal. That's handled by your terminal application. You can match Claude Code's theme to your terminal any time via the `/config` command.

For additional customization of the Claude Code interface itself, you can configure a [custom status line](/en/statusline) to display contextual information like the current model, working directory, or git branch at the bottom of your terminal.

### Line breaks

You have several options for entering line breaks into Claude Code:

* **Quick escape**: Type `\` followed by Enter to create a newline
* **Keyboard shortcut**: Set up a keybinding to insert a newline

#### Set up Shift+Enter (VS Code or iTerm2):

Run `/terminal-setup` within Claude Code to automatically configure Shift+Enter.

#### Set up Option+Enter (VS Code, iTerm2 or macOS Terminal.app):

**For Mac Terminal.app:**

1. Open Settings → Profiles → Keyboard
2. Check "Use Option as Meta Key"

**For iTerm2 and VS Code terminal:**

1. Open Settings → Profiles → Keys
2. Under General, set Left/Right Option key to "Esc+"

### Notification setup

Never miss when Claude completes a task with proper notification configuration:

#### iTerm 2 system notifications

For iTerm 2 alerts when tasks complete:

1. Open iTerm 2 Preferences
2. Navigate to Profiles → Terminal
3. Enable "Silence bell" and Filter Alerts → "Send escape sequence-generated alerts"
4. Set your preferred notification delay

Note that these notifications are specific to iTerm 2 and not available in the default macOS Terminal.

#### Custom notification hooks

For advanced notification handling, you can create [notification hooks](/en/hooks#notification) to run your own logic.

### Handling large inputs

When working with extensive code or long instructions:

* **Avoid direct pasting**: Claude Code may struggle with very long pasted content
* **Use file-based workflows**: Write content to a file and ask Claude to read it
* **Be aware of VS Code limitations**: The VS Code terminal is particularly prone to truncating long pastes

### Vim Mode

Claude Code supports a subset of Vim keybindings that can be enabled with `/vim` or configured via `/config`.

The supported subset includes:

* Mode switching: `Esc` (to NORMAL), `i`/`I`, `a`/`A`, `o`/`O` (to INSERT)
* Navigation: `h`/`j`/`k`/`l`, `w`/`e`/`b`, `0`/`$`/`^`, `gg`/`G`
* Editing: `x`, `dw`/`de`/`db`/`dd`/`D`, `cw`/`ce`/`cb`/`cc`/`C`, `.` (repeat)

# Model configuration

> Learn about the Claude Code model configuration, including model aliases like `opusplan`

## Available models

For the `model` setting in Claude Code, you can configure either:

* A **model alias**
* A **model name**
  * Anthropic API: A full **[model name](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/overview#model-names)**
  * Bedrock: an inference profile ARN
  * Foundry: a deployment name
  * Vertex: a version name

### Model aliases

Model aliases provide a convenient way to select model settings without
remembering exact version numbers:

| Model alias      | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`default`**    | Recommended model setting, depending on your account type                                                                                                               |
| **`sonnet`**     | Uses the latest Sonnet model (currently Sonnet 4.5) for daily coding tasks                                                                                              |
| **`opus`**       | Uses Opus model (currently Opus 4.5) for specialized complex reasoning tasks                                                                                            |
| **`haiku`**      | Uses the fast and efficient Haiku model for simple tasks                                                                                                                |
| **`sonnet[1m]`** | Uses Sonnet with a [1 million token context window](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/context-windows#1m-token-context-window) window for long sessions |
| **`opusplan`**   | Special mode that uses `opus` during plan mode, then switches to `sonnet` for execution                                                                                 |

### Setting your model

You can configure your model in several ways, listed in order of priority:

1. **During session** - Use `/model <alias|name>` to switch models mid-session
2. **At startup** - Launch with `claude --model <alias|name>`
3. **Environment variable** - Set `ANTHROPIC_MODEL=<alias|name>`
4. **Settings** - Configure permanently in your settings file using the `model`
   field.

Example usage:

```bash  theme={null}
# Start with Opus
claude --model opus

# Switch to Sonnet during session
/model sonnet
```

Example settings file:

```
{
    "permissions": {
        ...
    },
    "model": "opus"
}
```

## Special model behavior

### `default` model setting

The behavior of `default` depends on your account type.

For certain Max users, Claude Code will automatically fall back to Sonnet if you
hit a usage threshold with Opus.

### `opusplan` model setting

The `opusplan` model alias provides an automated hybrid approach:

* **In plan mode** - Uses `opus` for complex reasoning and architecture
  decisions
* **In execution mode** - Automatically switches to `sonnet` for code generation
  and implementation

This gives you the best of both worlds: Opus's superior reasoning for planning,
and Sonnet's efficiency for execution.

### Extended context with \[1m]

For Console/API users, the `[1m]` suffix can be added to full model names to
enable a
[1 million token context window](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/context-windows#1m-token-context-window).

```bash  theme={null}
# Example of using a full model name with the [1m] suffix
/model anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0[1m]
```

Note: Extended context models have
[different pricing](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/about-claude/pricing#long-context-pricing).

## Checking your current model

You can see which model you're currently using in several ways:

1. In [status line](/en/statusline) (if configured)
2. In `/status`, which also displays your account information.

## Environment variables

You can use the following environment variables, which must be full **model
names** (or equivalent for your API provider), to control the model names that the aliases map to.

| Environment variable             | Description                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL`   | The model to use for `opus`, or for `opusplan` when Plan Mode is active.                      |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL` | The model to use for `sonnet`, or for `opusplan` when Plan Mode is not active.                |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL`  | The model to use for `haiku`, or [background functionality](/en/costs#background-token-usage) |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL`     | The model to use for [subagents](/en/sub-agents)                                              |

Note: `ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL` is deprecated in favor of
`ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL`.

### Prompt caching configuration

Claude Code automatically uses [prompt caching](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching) to optimize performance and reduce costs. You can disable prompt caching globally or for specific model tiers:

| Environment variable            | Description                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING`        | Set to `1` to disable prompt caching for all models (takes precedence over per-model settings) |
| `DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_HAIKU`  | Set to `1` to disable prompt caching for Haiku models only                                     |
| `DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_SONNET` | Set to `1` to disable prompt caching for Sonnet models only                                    |
| `DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_OPUS`   | Set to `1` to disable prompt caching for Opus models only                                      |

These environment variables give you fine-grained control over prompt caching behavior. The global `DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING` setting takes precedence over the model-specific settings, allowing you to quickly disable all caching when needed. The per-model settings are useful for selective control, such as when debugging specific models or working with cloud providers that may have different caching implementations.

# Manage Claude's memory

> Learn how to manage Claude Code's memory across sessions with different memory locations and best practices.

Claude Code can remember your preferences across sessions, like style guidelines and common commands in your workflow.

## Determine memory type

Claude Code offers four memory locations in a hierarchical structure, each serving a different purpose:

| Memory Type                | Location                                                                                                                                                        | Purpose                                             | Use Case Examples                                                    | Shared With                     |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Enterprise policy**      | • macOS: `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/CLAUDE.md`<br />• Linux: `/etc/claude-code/CLAUDE.md`<br />• Windows: `C:\Program Files\ClaudeCode\CLAUDE.md` | Organization-wide instructions managed by IT/DevOps | Company coding standards, security policies, compliance requirements | All users in organization       |
| **Project memory**         | `./CLAUDE.md` or `./.claude/CLAUDE.md`                                                                                                                          | Team-shared instructions for the project            | Project architecture, coding standards, common workflows             | Team members via source control |
| **Project rules**          | `./.claude/rules/*.md`                                                                                                                                          | Modular, topic-specific project instructions        | Language-specific guidelines, testing conventions, API standards     | Team members via source control |
| **User memory**            | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`                                                                                                                                           | Personal preferences for all projects               | Code styling preferences, personal tooling shortcuts                 | Just you (all projects)         |
| **Project memory (local)** | `./CLAUDE.local.md`                                                                                                                                             | Personal project-specific preferences               | Your sandbox URLs, preferred test data                               | Just you (current project)      |

All memory files are automatically loaded into Claude Code's context when launched. Files higher in the hierarchy take precedence and are loaded first, providing a foundation that more specific memories build upon.

<Note>
  CLAUDE.local.md files are automatically added to .gitignore, making them ideal for private project-specific preferences that shouldn't be checked into version control.
</Note>

## CLAUDE.md imports

CLAUDE.md files can import additional files using `@path/to/import` syntax. The following example imports 3 files:

```
See @README for project overview and @package.json for available npm commands for this project.

# Additional Instructions
- git workflow @docs/git-instructions.md
```

Both relative and absolute paths are allowed. In particular, importing files in user's home dir is a convenient way for your team members to provide individual instructions that are not checked into the repository. Imports are an alternative to CLAUDE.local.md that work better across multiple git worktrees.

```
# Individual Preferences
- @~/.claude/my-project-instructions.md
```

To avoid potential collisions, imports are not evaluated inside markdown code spans and code blocks.

```
This code span will not be treated as an import: `@anthropic-ai/claude-code`
```

Imported files can recursively import additional files, with a max-depth of 5 hops. You can see what memory files are loaded by running `/memory` command.

## How Claude looks up memories

Claude Code reads memories recursively: starting in the cwd, Claude Code recurses up to (but not including) the root directory */* and reads any CLAUDE.md or CLAUDE.local.md files it finds. This is especially convenient when working in large repositories where you run Claude Code in *foo/bar/*, and have memories in both *foo/CLAUDE.md* and *foo/bar/CLAUDE.md*.

Claude will also discover CLAUDE.md nested in subtrees under your current working directory. Instead of loading them at launch, they are only included when Claude reads files in those subtrees.

## Directly edit memories with `/memory`

Use the `/memory` slash command during a session to open any memory file in your system editor for more extensive additions or organization.

## Set up project memory

Suppose you want to set up a CLAUDE.md file to store important project information, conventions, and frequently used commands. Project memory can be stored in either `./CLAUDE.md` or `./.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

Bootstrap a CLAUDE.md for your codebase with the following command:

```
> /init
```

<Tip>
  Tips:

  * Include frequently used commands (build, test, lint) to avoid repeated searches
  * Document code style preferences and naming conventions
  * Add important architectural patterns specific to your project
  * CLAUDE.md memories can be used for both instructions shared with your team and for your individual preferences.
</Tip>

## Modular rules with `.claude/rules/`

For larger projects, you can organize instructions into multiple files using the `.claude/rules/` directory. This allows teams to maintain focused, well-organized rule files instead of one large CLAUDE.md.

### Basic structure

Place markdown files in your project's `.claude/rules/` directory:

```
your-project/
├── .claude/
│   ├── CLAUDE.md           # Main project instructions
│   └── rules/
│       ├── code-style.md   # Code style guidelines
│       ├── testing.md      # Testing conventions
│       └── security.md     # Security requirements
```

All `.md` files in `.claude/rules/` are automatically loaded as project memory, with the same priority as `.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

### Path-specific rules

Rules can be scoped to specific files using YAML frontmatter with the `paths` field. These conditional rules only apply when Claude is working with files matching the specified patterns.

```markdown  theme={null}
---
paths: src/api/**/*.ts
---

# API Development Rules

- All API endpoints must include input validation
- Use the standard error response format
- Include OpenAPI documentation comments
```

Rules without a `paths` field are loaded unconditionally and apply to all files.

### Glob patterns

The `paths` field supports standard glob patterns:

| Pattern                | Matches                                  |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `**/*.ts`              | All TypeScript files in any directory    |
| `src/**/*`             | All files under `src/` directory         |
| `*.md`                 | Markdown files in the project root       |
| `src/components/*.tsx` | React components in a specific directory |

You can use braces to match multiple patterns efficiently:

```markdown  theme={null}
---
paths: src/**/*.{ts,tsx}
---

# TypeScript/React Rules
```

This expands to match both `src/**/*.ts` and `src/**/*.tsx`. You can also combine multiple patterns with commas:

```markdown  theme={null}
---
paths: {src,lib}/**/*.ts, tests/**/*.test.ts
---
```

### Subdirectories

Rules can be organized into subdirectories for better structure:

```
.claude/rules/
├── frontend/
│   ├── react.md
│   └── styles.md
├── backend/
│   ├── api.md
│   └── database.md
└── general.md
```

All `.md` files are discovered recursively.

### Symlinks

The `.claude/rules/` directory supports symlinks, allowing you to share common rules across multiple projects:

```bash  theme={null}
# Symlink a shared rules directory
ln -s ~/shared-claude-rules .claude/rules/shared

# Symlink individual rule files
ln -s ~/company-standards/security.md .claude/rules/security.md
```

Symlinks are resolved and their contents are loaded normally. Circular symlinks are detected and handled gracefully.

### User-level rules

You can create personal rules that apply to all your projects in `~/.claude/rules/`:

```
~/.claude/rules/
├── preferences.md    # Your personal coding preferences
└── workflows.md      # Your preferred workflows
```

User-level rules are loaded before project rules, giving project rules higher priority.

<Tip>
  Best practices for `.claude/rules/`:

  * **Keep rules focused**: Each file should cover one topic (e.g., `testing.md`, `api-design.md`)
  * **Use descriptive filenames**: The filename should indicate what the rules cover
  * **Use conditional rules sparingly**: Only add `paths` frontmatter when rules truly apply to specific file types
  * **Organize with subdirectories**: Group related rules (e.g., `frontend/`, `backend/`)
</Tip>

## Organization-level memory management

Enterprise organizations can deploy centrally managed CLAUDE.md files that apply to all users.

To set up organization-level memory management:

1. Create the enterprise memory file at the **Enterprise policy** location shown in the [memory types table above](#determine-memory-type).

2. Deploy via your configuration management system (MDM, Group Policy, Ansible, etc.) to ensure consistent distribution across all developer machines.

## Memory best practices

* **Be specific**: "Use 2-space indentation" is better than "Format code properly".
* **Use structure to organize**: Format each individual memory as a bullet point and group related memories under descriptive markdown headings.
* **Review periodically**: Update memories as your project evolves to ensure Claude is always using the most up to date information and context.

# Status line configuration

> Create a custom status line for Claude Code to display contextual information

Make Claude Code your own with a custom status line that displays at the bottom of the Claude Code interface, similar to how terminal prompts (PS1) work in shells like Oh-my-zsh.

## Create a custom status line

You can either:

* Run `/statusline` to ask Claude Code to help you set up a custom status line. By default, it will try to reproduce your terminal's prompt, but you can provide additional instructions about the behavior you want to Claude Code, such as `/statusline show the model name in orange`

* Directly add a `statusLine` command to your `.claude/settings.json`:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "~/.claude/statusline.sh",
    "padding": 0 // Optional: set to 0 to let status line go to edge
  }
}
```

## How it Works

* The status line is updated when the conversation messages update
* Updates run at most every 300 ms
* The first line of stdout from your command becomes the status line text
* ANSI color codes are supported for styling your status line
* Claude Code passes contextual information about the current session (model, directories, etc.) as JSON to your script via stdin

## JSON Input Structure

Your status line command receives structured data via stdin in JSON format:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "hook_event_name": "Status",
  "session_id": "abc123...",
  "transcript_path": "/path/to/transcript.json",
  "cwd": "/current/working/directory",
  "model": {
    "id": "claude-opus-4-1",
    "display_name": "Opus"
  },
  "workspace": {
    "current_dir": "/current/working/directory",
    "project_dir": "/original/project/directory"
  },
  "version": "1.0.80",
  "output_style": {
    "name": "default"
  },
  "cost": {
    "total_cost_usd": 0.01234,
    "total_duration_ms": 45000,
    "total_api_duration_ms": 2300,
    "total_lines_added": 156,
    "total_lines_removed": 23
  },
  "context_window": {
    "total_input_tokens": 15234,
    "total_output_tokens": 4521,
    "context_window_size": 200000,
    "current_usage": {
      "input_tokens": 8500,
      "output_tokens": 1200,
      "cache_creation_input_tokens": 5000,
      "cache_read_input_tokens": 2000
    }
  }
}
```

## Example Scripts

### Simple Status Line

```bash  theme={null}
#!/bin/bash
# Read JSON input from stdin
input=$(cat)

# Extract values using jq
MODEL_DISPLAY=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.model.display_name')
CURRENT_DIR=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.workspace.current_dir')

echo "[$MODEL_DISPLAY] 📁 ${CURRENT_DIR##*/}"
```

### Git-Aware Status Line

```bash  theme={null}
#!/bin/bash
# Read JSON input from stdin
input=$(cat)

# Extract values using jq
MODEL_DISPLAY=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.model.display_name')
CURRENT_DIR=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.workspace.current_dir')

# Show git branch if in a git repo
GIT_BRANCH=""
if git rev-parse --git-dir > /dev/null 2>&1; then
    BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null)
    if [ -n "$BRANCH" ]; then
        GIT_BRANCH=" | 🌿 $BRANCH"
    fi
fi

echo "[$MODEL_DISPLAY] 📁 ${CURRENT_DIR##*/}$GIT_BRANCH"
```

### Python Example

```python  theme={null}
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import json
import sys
import os

# Read JSON from stdin
data = json.load(sys.stdin)

# Extract values
model = data['model']['display_name']
current_dir = os.path.basename(data['workspace']['current_dir'])

# Check for git branch
git_branch = ""
if os.path.exists('.git'):
    try:
        with open('.git/HEAD', 'r') as f:
            ref = f.read().strip()
            if ref.startswith('ref: refs/heads/'):
                git_branch = f" | 🌿 {ref.replace('ref: refs/heads/', '')}"
    except:
        pass

print(f"[{model}] 📁 {current_dir}{git_branch}")
```

### Node.js Example

```javascript  theme={null}
#!/usr/bin/env node

const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

// Read JSON from stdin
let input = '';
process.stdin.on('data', chunk => input += chunk);
process.stdin.on('end', () => {
    const data = JSON.parse(input);
    
    // Extract values
    const model = data.model.display_name;
    const currentDir = path.basename(data.workspace.current_dir);
    
    // Check for git branch
    let gitBranch = '';
    try {
        const headContent = fs.readFileSync('.git/HEAD', 'utf8').trim();
        if (headContent.startsWith('ref: refs/heads/')) {
            gitBranch = ` | 🌿 ${headContent.replace('ref: refs/heads/', '')}`;
        }
    } catch (e) {
        // Not a git repo or can't read HEAD
    }
    
    console.log(`[${model}] 📁 ${currentDir}${gitBranch}`);
});
```

### Helper Function Approach

For more complex bash scripts, you can create helper functions:

```bash  theme={null}
#!/bin/bash
# Read JSON input once
input=$(cat)

# Helper functions for common extractions
get_model_name() { echo "$input" | jq -r '.model.display_name'; }
get_current_dir() { echo "$input" | jq -r '.workspace.current_dir'; }
get_project_dir() { echo "$input" | jq -r '.workspace.project_dir'; }
get_version() { echo "$input" | jq -r '.version'; }
get_cost() { echo "$input" | jq -r '.cost.total_cost_usd'; }
get_duration() { echo "$input" | jq -r '.cost.total_duration_ms'; }
get_lines_added() { echo "$input" | jq -r '.cost.total_lines_added'; }
get_lines_removed() { echo "$input" | jq -r '.cost.total_lines_removed'; }
get_input_tokens() { echo "$input" | jq -r '.context_window.total_input_tokens'; }
get_output_tokens() { echo "$input" | jq -r '.context_window.total_output_tokens'; }
get_context_window_size() { echo "$input" | jq -r '.context_window.context_window_size'; }

# Use the helpers
MODEL=$(get_model_name)
DIR=$(get_current_dir)
echo "[$MODEL] 📁 ${DIR##*/}"
```

### Context Window Usage

Display the percentage of context window consumed. The `context_window` object contains:

* `total_input_tokens` / `total_output_tokens`: Cumulative totals across the entire session
* `current_usage`: Current context window usage from the last API call (may be `null` if no messages yet)
  * `input_tokens`: Input tokens in current context
  * `output_tokens`: Output tokens generated
  * `cache_creation_input_tokens`: Tokens written to cache
  * `cache_read_input_tokens`: Tokens read from cache

For accurate context percentage, use `current_usage` which reflects the actual context window state:

```bash  theme={null}
#!/bin/bash
input=$(cat)

MODEL=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.model.display_name')
CONTEXT_SIZE=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.context_window.context_window_size')
USAGE=$(echo "$input" | jq '.context_window.current_usage')

if [ "$USAGE" != "null" ]; then
    # Calculate current context from current_usage fields
    CURRENT_TOKENS=$(echo "$USAGE" | jq '.input_tokens + .cache_creation_input_tokens + .cache_read_input_tokens')
    PERCENT_USED=$((CURRENT_TOKENS * 100 / CONTEXT_SIZE))
    echo "[$MODEL] Context: ${PERCENT_USED}%"
else
    echo "[$MODEL] Context: 0%"
fi
```

## Tips

* Keep your status line concise - it should fit on one line
* Use emojis (if your terminal supports them) and colors to make information scannable
* Use `jq` for JSON parsing in Bash (see examples above)
* Test your script by running it manually with mock JSON input: `echo '{"model":{"display_name":"Test"},"workspace":{"current_dir":"/test"}}' | ./statusline.sh`
* Consider caching expensive operations (like git status) if needed

## Troubleshooting

* If your status line doesn't appear, check that your script is executable (`chmod +x`)
* Ensure your script outputs to stdout (not stderr)

<Tip>
  The `--output-format json` flag is particularly useful for scripting and
  automation, allowing you to parse Claude's responses programmatically.
</Tip>

### Agents flag format

The `--agents` flag accepts a JSON object that defines one or more custom subagents. Each subagent requires a unique name (as the key) and a definition object with the following fields:

| Field         | Required | Description                                                                                                            |
| :------------ | :------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `description` | Yes      | Natural language description of when the subagent should be invoked                                                    |
| `prompt`      | Yes      | The system prompt that guides the subagent's behavior                                                                  |
| `tools`       | No       | Array of specific tools the subagent can use (for example, `["Read", "Edit", "Bash"]`). If omitted, inherits all tools |
| `model`       | No       | Model alias to use: `sonnet`, `opus`, or `haiku`. If omitted, uses the default subagent model                          |

Example:

```bash  theme={null}
claude --agents '{
  "code-reviewer": {
    "description": "Expert code reviewer. Use proactively after code changes.",
    "prompt": "You are a senior code reviewer. Focus on code quality, security, and best practices.",
    "tools": ["Read", "Grep", "Glob", "Bash"],
    "model": "sonnet"
  },
  "debugger": {
    "description": "Debugging specialist for errors and test failures.",
    "prompt": "You are an expert debugger. Analyze errors, identify root causes, and provide fixes."
  }
}'
```

For more details on creating and using subagents, see the [subagents documentation](/en/sub-agents).

### System prompt flags

Claude Code provides three flags for customizing the system prompt, each serving a different purpose:

| Flag                     | Behavior                           | Modes               | Use Case                                                             |
| :----------------------- | :--------------------------------- | :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--system-prompt`        | **Replaces** entire default prompt | Interactive + Print | Complete control over Claude's behavior and instructions             |
| `--system-prompt-file`   | **Replaces** with file contents    | Print only          | Load prompts from files for reproducibility and version control      |
| `--append-system-prompt` | **Appends** to default prompt      | Interactive + Print | Add specific instructions while keeping default Claude Code behavior |

**When to use each:**

* **`--system-prompt`**: Use when you need complete control over Claude's system prompt. This removes all default Claude Code instructions, giving you a blank slate.
  ```bash  theme={null}
  claude --system-prompt "You are a Python expert who only writes type-annotated code"
  ```

* **`--system-prompt-file`**: Use when you want to load a custom prompt from a file, useful for team consistency or version-controlled prompt templates.
  ```bash  theme={null}
  claude -p --system-prompt-file ./prompts/code-review.txt "Review this PR"
  ```

* **`--append-system-prompt`**: Use when you want to add specific instructions while keeping Claude Code's default capabilities intact. This is the safest option for most use cases.
  ```bash  theme={null}
  claude --append-system-prompt "Always use TypeScript and include JSDoc comments"
  ```

<Note>
  `--system-prompt` and `--system-prompt-file` are mutually exclusive. You cannot use both flags simultaneously.
</Note>

<Tip>
  For most use cases, `--append-system-prompt` is recommended as it preserves Claude Code's built-in capabilities while adding your custom requirements. Use `--system-prompt` or `--system-prompt-file` only when you need complete control over the system prompt.
</Tip>

For detailed information about print mode (`-p`) including output formats,
streaming, verbose logging, and programmatic usage, see the
[SDK documentation](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agent-sdk).

| `cw`/`ce`/`cb` | Change word/to end/back |
| `.`            | Repeat last change      |

## Command history

Claude Code maintains command history for the current session:

* History is stored per working directory
* Cleared with `/clear` command
* Use Up/Down arrows to navigate (see keyboard shortcuts above)
* **Note**: History expansion (`!`) is disabled by default

### Reverse search with Ctrl+R

Press `Ctrl+R` to interactively search through your command history:

1. **Start search**: Press `Ctrl+R` to activate reverse history search
2. **Type query**: Enter text to search for in previous commands - the search term will be highlighted in matching results
3. **Navigate matches**: Press `Ctrl+R` again to cycle through older matches
4. **Accept match**:
   * Press `Tab` or `Esc` to accept the current match and continue editing
   * Press `Enter` to accept and execute the command immediately
5. **Cancel search**:
   * Press `Ctrl+C` to cancel and restore your original input
   * Press `Backspace` on empty search to cancel

The search displays matching commands with the search term highlighted, making it easy to find and reuse previous inputs.

## Background bash commands

Claude Code supports running bash commands in the background, allowing you to continue working while long-running processes execute.

### How backgrounding works

When Claude Code runs a command in the background, it runs the command asynchronously and immediately returns a background task ID. Claude Code can respond to new prompts while the command continues executing in the background.

To run commands in the background, you can either:

* Prompt Claude Code to run a command in the background
* Press Ctrl+B to move a regular Bash tool invocation to the background. (Tmux users must press Ctrl+B twice due to tmux's prefix key.)

**Key features:**

* Output is buffered and Claude can retrieve it using the BashOutput tool
* Background tasks have unique IDs for tracking and output retrieval
* Background tasks are automatically cleaned up when Claude Code exits

**Common backgrounded commands:**

* Build tools (webpack, vite, make)
* Package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm)
* Test runners (jest, pytest)
* Development servers
* Long-running processes (docker, terraform)

### Bash mode with `!` prefix

Run bash commands directly without going through Claude by prefixing your input with `!`:

```bash  theme={null}
! npm test
! git status
! ls -la
```

Bash mode:

* Adds the command and its output to the conversation context
* Shows real-time progress and output
* Supports the same `Ctrl+B` backgrounding for long-running commands
* Does not require Claude to interpret or approve the command

This is useful for quick shell operations while maintaining conversation context.

## Custom slash commands

Custom slash commands allow you to define frequently used prompts as Markdown files that Claude Code can execute. Commands are organized by scope (project-specific or personal) and support namespacing through directory structures.

### Syntax

```
/<command-name> [arguments]
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter        | Description                                                       |
| :--------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<command-name>` | Name derived from the Markdown filename (without `.md` extension) |
| `[arguments]`    | Optional arguments passed to the command                          |

### Command types

#### Project commands

Commands stored in your repository and shared with your team. When listed in `/help`, these commands show "(project)" after their description.

**Location**: `.claude/commands/`

The following example creates the `/optimize` command:

```bash  theme={null}
# Create a project command
mkdir -p .claude/commands
echo "Analyze this code for performance issues and suggest optimizations:" > .claude/commands/optimize.md
```

#### Personal commands

Commands available across all your projects. When listed in `/help`, these commands show "(user)" after their description.

**Location**: `~/.claude/commands/`

The following example creates the `/security-review` command:

```bash  theme={null}
# Create a personal command
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands
echo "Review this code for security vulnerabilities:" > ~/.claude/commands/security-review.md
```

### Features

#### Namespacing

Use subdirectories to group related commands. Subdirectories appear in the command description but don't affect the command name.

For example:

* `.claude/commands/frontend/component.md` creates `/component` with description "(project:frontend)"
* `~/.claude/commands/component.md` creates `/component` with description "(user)"

If a project command and user command share the same name, the project command takes precedence and the user command is silently ignored. For example, if both `.claude/commands/deploy.md` and `~/.claude/commands/deploy.md` exist, `/deploy` runs the project version.

Commands in different subdirectories can share names since the subdirectory appears in the description to distinguish them. For example, `.claude/commands/frontend/test.md` and `.claude/commands/backend/test.md` both create `/test`, but show as "(project:frontend)" and "(project:backend)" respectively.

#### Arguments

Pass dynamic values to commands using argument placeholders:

##### All arguments with `$ARGUMENTS`

The `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder captures all arguments passed to the command:

```bash  theme={null}
# Command definition
echo 'Fix issue #$ARGUMENTS following our coding standards' > .claude/commands/fix-issue.md

# Usage
> /fix-issue 123 high-priority
# $ARGUMENTS becomes: "123 high-priority"
```

##### Individual arguments with `$1`, `$2`, etc.

Access specific arguments individually using positional parameters (similar to shell scripts):

```bash  theme={null}
# Command definition  
echo 'Review PR #$1 with priority $2 and assign to $3' > .claude/commands/review-pr.md

# Usage
> /review-pr 456 high alice
# $1 becomes "456", $2 becomes "high", $3 becomes "alice"
```

Use positional arguments when you need to:

* Access arguments individually in different parts of your command
* Provide defaults for missing arguments
* Build more structured commands with specific parameter roles

#### Bash command execution

Execute bash commands before the slash command runs using the `!` prefix. The output is included in the command context. You *must* include `allowed-tools` with the `Bash` tool, but you can choose the specific bash commands to allow.

For example:

```markdown  theme={null}
---
allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*), Bash(git commit:*)
description: Create a git commit
---

## Context

- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): !`git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -10`

## Your task

Based on the above changes, create a single git commit.
```

#### File references

Include file contents in commands using the `@` prefix to [reference files](/en/common-workflows#reference-files-and-directories).

For example:

```markdown  theme={null}
# Reference a specific file

Review the implementation in @src/utils/helpers.js

# Reference multiple files

Compare @src/old-version.js with @src/new-version.js
```

#### Thinking mode

Slash commands can trigger extended thinking by including [extended thinking keywords](/en/common-workflows#use-extended-thinking).

### Frontmatter

Command files support frontmatter, useful for specifying metadata about the command:

| Frontmatter                | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                               | Default                             |
| :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------- |
| `allowed-tools`            | List of tools the command can use                                                                                                                                                     | Inherits from the conversation      |
| `argument-hint`            | The arguments expected for the slash command. Example: `argument-hint: add [tagId] \| remove [tagId] \| list`. This hint is shown to the user when auto-completing the slash command. | None                                |
| `description`              | Brief description of the command                                                                                                                                                      | Uses the first line from the prompt |
| `model`                    | Specific model string (see [Models overview](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/overview))                                                                           | Inherits from the conversation      |
| `disable-model-invocation` | Whether to prevent `SlashCommand` tool from calling this command                                                                                                                      | false                               |

For example:

```markdown  theme={null}
---
allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*), Bash(git commit:*)
argument-hint: [message]
description: Create a git commit
model: claude-3-5-haiku-20241022
---

Create a git commit with message: $ARGUMENTS
```

Example using positional arguments:

```markdown  theme={null}
---
argument-hint: [pr-number] [priority] [assignee]
description: Review pull request
---

Review PR #$1 with priority $2 and assign to $3.
Focus on security, performance, and code style.
```

## Plugin commands

[Plugins](/en/plugins) can provide custom slash commands that integrate seamlessly with Claude Code. Plugin commands work exactly like user-defined commands but are distributed through [plugin marketplaces](/en/plugin-marketplaces).

### How plugin commands work

Plugin commands are:

* **Namespaced**: Commands can use the format `/plugin-name:command-name` to avoid conflicts (plugin prefix is optional unless there are name collisions)
* **Automatically available**: Once a plugin is installed and enabled, its commands appear in `/help`
* **Fully integrated**: Support all command features (arguments, frontmatter, bash execution, file references)

### Plugin command structure

**Location**: `commands/` directory in plugin root

**File format**: Markdown files with frontmatter

**Basic command structure**:

```markdown  theme={null}
---
description: Brief description of what the command does
---

# Command Name

Detailed instructions for Claude on how to execute this command.
Include specific guidance on parameters, expected outcomes, and any special considerations.
```

**Advanced command features**:

* **Arguments**: Use placeholders like `{arg1}` in command descriptions
* **Subdirectories**: Organize commands in subdirectories for namespacing
* **Bash integration**: Commands can execute shell scripts and programs
* **File references**: Commands can reference and modify project files

### Invocation patterns

```shell Direct command (when no conflicts) theme={null}
/command-name
```

```shell Plugin-prefixed (when needed for disambiguation) theme={null}
/plugin-name:command-name
```

```shell With arguments (if command supports them) theme={null}
/command-name arg1 arg2
```

## MCP slash commands

MCP servers can expose prompts as slash commands that become available in Claude Code. These commands are dynamically discovered from connected MCP servers.

### Command format

MCP commands follow the pattern:

```
/mcp__<server-name>__<prompt-name> [arguments]
```

### Features

#### Dynamic discovery

MCP commands are automatically available when:

* An MCP server is connected and active
* The server exposes prompts through the MCP protocol
* The prompts are successfully retrieved during connection

#### Arguments

MCP prompts can accept arguments defined by the server:

```
# Without arguments
> /mcp__github__list_prs

# With arguments
> /mcp__github__pr_review 456
> /mcp__jira__create_issue "Bug title" high
```

#### Naming conventions

Server and prompt names are normalized:

* Spaces and special characters become underscores
* Names are lowercase for consistency

### Managing MCP connections

Use the `/mcp` command to:

* View all configured MCP servers
* Check connection status
* Authenticate with OAuth-enabled servers
* Clear authentication tokens
* View available tools and prompts from each server

### MCP permissions and wildcards

To approve all tools from an MCP server, use either the server name alone or wildcard syntax:

* `mcp__github` (approves all GitHub tools)
* `mcp__github__*` (wildcard syntax, also approves all GitHub tools)

To approve specific tools, list each one explicitly:

* `mcp__github__get_issue`
* `mcp__github__list_issues`

See [MCP permission rules](/en/iam#tool-specific-permission-rules) for more details.

## `SlashCommand` tool

The `SlashCommand` tool allows Claude to execute [custom slash commands](/en/slash-commands#custom-slash-commands) programmatically
during a conversation. This gives Claude the ability to invoke custom commands
on your behalf when appropriate.

To encourage Claude to use the `SlashCommand` tool, reference the command by name, including the slash, in your prompts or `CLAUDE.md` file. For example:

```
> Run /write-unit-test when you are about to start writing tests.
```

This tool puts each available custom slash command's metadata into context up to the character budget limit. You can use `/context` to monitor token usage and follow the operations below to manage context.

### `SlashCommand` tool supported commands

`SlashCommand` tool only supports custom slash commands that:

* Are user-defined. Built-in commands like `/compact` and `/init` are *not* supported.
* Have the `description` frontmatter field populated. The description is used in the context.

For Claude Code versions >= 1.0.124, you can see which custom slash commands
`SlashCommand` tool can invoke by running `claude --debug` and triggering a query.

### Disable `SlashCommand` tool

To prevent Claude from executing any slash commands via the tool:

```bash  theme={null}
/permissions
# Add to deny rules: SlashCommand
```

This also removes the SlashCommand tool and command descriptions from context.

### Disable specific commands only

To prevent a specific slash command from becoming available, add
`disable-model-invocation: true` to the slash command's frontmatter.

This also removes the command's metadata from context.

### `SlashCommand` permission rules

The permission rules support:

* **Exact match**: `SlashCommand:/commit` (allows only `/commit` with no arguments)
* **Prefix match**: `SlashCommand:/review-pr:*` (allows `/review-pr` with any arguments)

### Character budget limit

The `SlashCommand` tool includes a character budget to limit the size of command
descriptions shown to Claude. This prevents token overflow when many commands
are available.

The budget includes each custom slash command's name, arguments, and description.

* **Default limit**: 15,000 characters
* **Custom limit**: Set via `SLASH_COMMAND_TOOL_CHAR_BUDGET` environment variable

When the character budget is exceeded, Claude sees only a subset of the available commands. In `/context`, a warning shows "M of N commands".

## Skills vs slash commands

**Slash commands** and **Agent Skills** serve different purposes in Claude Code:

### Use slash commands for

**Quick, frequently used prompts**:

* Simple prompt snippets you use often
* Quick reminders or templates
* Frequently used instructions that fit in one file

**Examples**:

* `/review` → "Review this code for bugs and suggest improvements"
* `/explain` → "Explain this code in simple terms"
* `/optimize` → "Analyze this code for performance issues"

### Use Skills for

**Comprehensive capabilities with structure**:

* Complex workflows with multiple steps
* Capabilities requiring scripts or utilities
* Knowledge organized across multiple files
* Team workflows you want to standardize

**Examples**:

* PDF processing Skill with form-filling scripts and validation
* Data analysis Skill with reference docs for different data types
* Documentation Skill with style guides and templates

### Key differences

| Aspect         | Slash Commands                   | Agent Skills                        |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Complexity** | Simple prompts                   | Complex capabilities                |
| **Structure**  | Single .md file                  | Directory with SKILL.md + resources |
| **Discovery**  | Explicit invocation (`/command`) | Automatic (based on context)        |
| **Files**      | One file only                    | Multiple files, scripts, templates  |
| **Scope**      | Project or personal              | Project or personal                 |
| **Sharing**    | Via git                          | Via git                             |

### Example comparison

**As a slash command**:

```markdown  theme={null}
# .claude/commands/review.md
Review this code for:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues
- Code style violations
```

Usage: `/review` (manual invocation)

**As a Skill**:

```
.claude/skills/code-review/
├── SKILL.md (overview and workflows)
├── SECURITY.md (security checklist)
├── PERFORMANCE.md (performance patterns)
├── STYLE.md (style guide reference)
└── scripts/
    └── run-linters.sh
```

Usage: "Can you review this code?" (automatic discovery)

The Skill provides richer context, validation scripts, and organized reference material.

### When to use each

**Use slash commands**:

* You invoke the same prompt repeatedly
* The prompt fits in a single file
* You want explicit control over when it runs

**Use Skills**:

* Claude should discover the capability automatically
* Multiple files or scripts are needed
* Complex workflows with validation steps
* Team needs standardized, detailed guidance

Both slash commands and Skills can coexist. Use the approach that fits your needs.

## Custom slash commands

Custom slash commands allow you to define frequently used prompts as Markdown files that Claude Code can execute. Commands are organized by scope (project-specific or personal) and support namespacing through directory structures.

### Syntax

```
/<command-name> [arguments]
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter        | Description                                                       |
| :--------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<command-name>` | Name derived from the Markdown filename (without `.md` extension) |
| `[arguments]`    | Optional arguments passed to the command                          |

### Command types

#### Project commands

Commands stored in your repository and shared with your team. When listed in `/help`, these commands show "(project)" after their description.

**Location**: `.claude/commands/`

The following example creates the `/optimize` command:

```bash  theme={null}
# Create a project command
mkdir -p .claude/commands
echo "Analyze this code for performance issues and suggest optimizations:" > .claude/commands/optimize.md
```

#### Personal commands

Commands available across all your projects. When listed in `/help`, these commands show "(user)" after their description.

**Location**: `~/.claude/commands/`

The following example creates the `/security-review` command:

```bash  theme={null}
# Create a personal command
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands
echo "Review this code for security vulnerabilities:" > ~/.claude/commands/security-review.md
```

### Features

#### Namespacing

Use subdirectories to group related commands. Subdirectories appear in the command description but don't affect the command name.

For example:

* `.claude/commands/frontend/component.md` creates `/component` with description "(project:frontend)"
* `~/.claude/commands/component.md` creates `/component` with description "(user)"

If a project command and user command share the same name, the project command takes precedence and the user command is silently ignored. For example, if both `.claude/commands/deploy.md` and `~/.claude/commands/deploy.md` exist, `/deploy` runs the project version.

Commands in different subdirectories can share names since the subdirectory appears in the description to distinguish them. For example, `.claude/commands/frontend/test.md` and `.claude/commands/backend/test.md` both create `/test`, but show as "(project:frontend)" and "(project:backend)" respectively.

#### Arguments

Pass dynamic values to commands using argument placeholders:

##### All arguments with `$ARGUMENTS`

The `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder captures all arguments passed to the command:

```bash  theme={null}
# Command definition
echo 'Fix issue #$ARGUMENTS following our coding standards' > .claude/commands/fix-issue.md

# Usage
> /fix-issue 123 high-priority
# $ARGUMENTS becomes: "123 high-priority"
```

##### Individual arguments with `$1`, `$2`, etc.

Access specific arguments individually using positional parameters (similar to shell scripts):

```bash  theme={null}
# Command definition  
echo 'Review PR #$1 with priority $2 and assign to $3' > .claude/commands/review-pr.md

# Usage
> /review-pr 456 high alice
# $1 becomes "456", $2 becomes "high", $3 becomes "alice"
```

Use positional arguments when you need to:

* Access arguments individually in different parts of your command
* Provide defaults for missing arguments
* Build more structured commands with specific parameter roles

#### Bash command execution

Execute bash commands before the slash command runs using the `!` prefix. The output is included in the command context. You *must* include `allowed-tools` with the `Bash` tool, but you can choose the specific bash commands to allow.

For example:

```markdown  theme={null}
---
allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*), Bash(git commit:*)
description: Create a git commit
---

## Context

- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): !`git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -10`

## Your task

Based on the above changes, create a single git commit.
```

#### File references

Include file contents in commands using the `@` prefix to [reference files](/en/common-workflows#reference-files-and-directories).

For example:

```markdown  theme={null}
# Reference a specific file

Review the implementation in @src/utils/helpers.js

# Reference multiple files

Compare @src/old-version.js with @src/new-version.js
```

#### Thinking mode

Slash commands can trigger extended thinking by including [extended thinking keywords](/en/common-workflows#use-extended-thinking).

### Frontmatter

Command files support frontmatter, useful for specifying metadata about the command:

| Frontmatter                | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                               | Default                             |
| :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------- |
| `allowed-tools`            | List of tools the command can use                                                                                                                                                     | Inherits from the conversation      |
| `argument-hint`            | The arguments expected for the slash command. Example: `argument-hint: add [tagId] \| remove [tagId] \| list`. This hint is shown to the user when auto-completing the slash command. | None                                |
| `description`              | Brief description of the command                                                                                                                                                      | Uses the first line from the prompt |
| `model`                    | Specific model string (see [Models overview](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/overview))                                                                           | Inherits from the conversation      |
| `disable-model-invocation` | Whether to prevent `SlashCommand` tool from calling this command                                                                                                                      | false                               |

For example:

```markdown  theme={null}
---
allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*), Bash(git commit:*)
argument-hint: [message]
description: Create a git commit
model: claude-3-5-haiku-20241022
---

Create a git commit with message: $ARGUMENTS
```

Example using positional arguments:

```markdown  theme={null}
---
argument-hint: [pr-number] [priority] [assignee]
description: Review pull request
---

Review PR #$1 with priority $2 and assign to $3.
Focus on security, performance, and code style.
```

## Plugin commands

[Plugins](/en/plugins) can provide custom slash commands that integrate seamlessly with Claude Code. Plugin commands work exactly like user-defined commands but are distributed through [plugin marketplaces](/en/plugin-marketplaces).

### How plugin commands work

Plugin commands are:

* **Namespaced**: Commands can use the format `/plugin-name:command-name` to avoid conflicts (plugin prefix is optional unless there are name collisions)
* **Automatically available**: Once a plugin is installed and enabled, its commands appear in `/help`
* **Fully integrated**: Support all command features (arguments, frontmatter, bash execution, file references)

### Plugin command structure

**Location**: `commands/` directory in plugin root

**File format**: Markdown files with frontmatter

**Basic command structure**:

```markdown  theme={null}
---
description: Brief description of what the command does
---

# Command Name

Detailed instructions for Claude on how to execute this command.
Include specific guidance on parameters, expected outcomes, and any special considerations.
```

**Advanced command features**:

* **Arguments**: Use placeholders like `{arg1}` in command descriptions
* **Subdirectories**: Organize commands in subdirectories for namespacing
* **Bash integration**: Commands can execute shell scripts and programs
* **File references**: Commands can reference and modify project files

### Invocation patterns

```shell Direct command (when no conflicts) theme={null}
/command-name
```

```shell Plugin-prefixed (when needed for disambiguation) theme={null}
/plugin-name:command-name
```

```shell With arguments (if command supports them) theme={null}
/command-name arg1 arg2
```

## MCP slash commands

MCP servers can expose prompts as slash commands that become available in Claude Code. These commands are dynamically discovered from connected MCP servers.

### Command format

MCP commands follow the pattern:

```
/mcp__<server-name>__<prompt-name> [arguments]
```

### Features

#### Dynamic discovery

MCP commands are automatically available when:

* An MCP server is connected and active
* The server exposes prompts through the MCP protocol
* The prompts are successfully retrieved during connection

#### Arguments

MCP prompts can accept arguments defined by the server:

```
# Without arguments
> /mcp__github__list_prs

# With arguments
> /mcp__github__pr_review 456
> /mcp__jira__create_issue "Bug title" high
```

#### Naming conventions

Server and prompt names are normalized:

* Spaces and special characters become underscores
* Names are lowercase for consistency

### Managing MCP connections

Use the `/mcp` command to:

* View all configured MCP servers
* Check connection status
* Authenticate with OAuth-enabled servers
* Clear authentication tokens
* View available tools and prompts from each server

### MCP permissions and wildcards

To approve all tools from an MCP server, use either the server name alone or wildcard syntax:

* `mcp__github` (approves all GitHub tools)
* `mcp__github__*` (wildcard syntax, also approves all GitHub tools)

To approve specific tools, list each one explicitly:

* `mcp__github__get_issue`
* `mcp__github__list_issues`

See [MCP permission rules](/en/iam#tool-specific-permission-rules) for more details.

## `SlashCommand` tool

The `SlashCommand` tool allows Claude to execute [custom slash commands](/en/slash-commands#custom-slash-commands) programmatically
during a conversation. This gives Claude the ability to invoke custom commands
on your behalf when appropriate.

To encourage Claude to use the `SlashCommand` tool, reference the command by name, including the slash, in your prompts or `CLAUDE.md` file. For example:

```
> Run /write-unit-test when you are about to start writing tests.
```

This tool puts each available custom slash command's metadata into context up to the character budget limit. You can use `/context` to monitor token usage and follow the operations below to manage context.

### `SlashCommand` tool supported commands

`SlashCommand` tool only supports custom slash commands that:

* Are user-defined. Built-in commands like `/compact` and `/init` are *not* supported.
* Have the `description` frontmatter field populated. The description is used in the context.

For Claude Code versions >= 1.0.124, you can see which custom slash commands
`SlashCommand` tool can invoke by running `claude --debug` and triggering a query.

### Disable `SlashCommand` tool

To prevent Claude from executing any slash commands via the tool:

```bash  theme={null}
/permissions
# Add to deny rules: SlashCommand
```

This also removes the SlashCommand tool and command descriptions from context.

### Disable specific commands only

To prevent a specific slash command from becoming available, add
`disable-model-invocation: true` to the slash command's frontmatter.

This also removes the command's metadata from context.

### `SlashCommand` permission rules

The permission rules support:

* **Exact match**: `SlashCommand:/commit` (allows only `/commit` with no arguments)
* **Prefix match**: `SlashCommand:/review-pr:*` (allows `/review-pr` with any arguments)

### Character budget limit

The `SlashCommand` tool includes a character budget to limit the size of command
descriptions shown to Claude. This prevents token overflow when many commands
are available.

The budget includes each custom slash command's name, arguments, and description.

* **Default limit**: 15,000 characters
* **Custom limit**: Set via `SLASH_COMMAND_TOOL_CHAR_BUDGET` environment variable

When the character budget is exceeded, Claude sees only a subset of the available commands. In `/context`, a warning shows "M of N commands".

## Skills vs slash commands

**Slash commands** and **Agent Skills** serve different purposes in Claude Code:

### Use slash commands for

**Quick, frequently used prompts**:

* Simple prompt snippets you use often
* Quick reminders or templates
* Frequently used instructions that fit in one file

**Examples**:

* `/review` → "Review this code for bugs and suggest improvements"
* `/explain` → "Explain this code in simple terms"
* `/optimize` → "Analyze this code for performance issues"

### Use Skills for

**Comprehensive capabilities with structure**:

* Complex workflows with multiple steps
* Capabilities requiring scripts or utilities
* Knowledge organized across multiple files
* Team workflows you want to standardize

**Examples**:

* PDF processing Skill with form-filling scripts and validation
* Data analysis Skill with reference docs for different data types
* Documentation Skill with style guides and templates

### Key differences

| Aspect         | Slash Commands                   | Agent Skills                        |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Complexity** | Simple prompts                   | Complex capabilities                |
| **Structure**  | Single .md file                  | Directory with SKILL.md + resources |
| **Discovery**  | Explicit invocation (`/command`) | Automatic (based on context)        |
| **Files**      | One file only                    | Multiple files, scripts, templates  |
| **Scope**      | Project or personal              | Project or personal                 |
| **Sharing**    | Via git                          | Via git                             |

### Example comparison

**As a slash command**:

```markdown  theme={null}
# .claude/commands/review.md
Review this code for:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues
- Code style violations
```

Usage: `/review` (manual invocation)

**As a Skill**:

```
.claude/skills/code-review/
├── SKILL.md (overview and workflows)
├── SECURITY.md (security checklist)
├── PERFORMANCE.md (performance patterns)
├── STYLE.md (style guide reference)
└── scripts/
    └── run-linters.sh
```

Usage: "Can you review this code?" (automatic discovery)

The Skill provides richer context, validation scripts, and organized reference material.

### When to use each

**Use slash commands**:

* You invoke the same prompt repeatedly
* The prompt fits in a single file
* You want explicit control over when it runs

**Use Skills**:

* Claude should discover the capability automatically
* Multiple files or scripts are needed
* Complex workflows with validation steps
* Team needs standardized, detailed guidance

Both slash commands and Skills can coexist. Use the approach that fits your needs.

# Hooks reference

> This page provides reference documentation for implementing hooks in Claude Code.

<Tip>
  For a quickstart guide with examples, see [Get started with Claude Code hooks](/en/hooks-guide).
</Tip>

## Configuration

Claude Code hooks are configured in your [settings files](/en/settings):

* `~/.claude/settings.json` - User settings
* `.claude/settings.json` - Project settings
* `.claude/settings.local.json` - Local project settings (not committed)
* Enterprise managed policy settings

<Note>
  Enterprise administrators can use `allowManagedHooksOnly` to block user, project, and plugin hooks. See [Hook configuration](/en/settings#hook-configuration).
</Note>

### Structure

Hooks are organized by matchers, where each matcher can have multiple hooks:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "hooks": {
    "EventName": [
      {
        "matcher": "ToolPattern",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "your-command-here"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

* **matcher**: Pattern to match tool names, case-sensitive (only applicable for
  `PreToolUse`, `PermissionRequest`, and `PostToolUse`)
  * Simple strings match exactly: `Write` matches only the Write tool
  * Supports regex: `Edit|Write` or `Notebook.*`
  * Use `*` to match all tools. You can also use empty string (`""`) or leave
    `matcher` blank.
* **hooks**: Array of hooks to execute when the pattern matches
  * `type`: Hook execution type - `"command"` for bash commands or `"prompt"` for LLM-based evaluation
  * `command`: (For `type: "command"`) The bash command to execute (can use `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` environment variable)
  * `prompt`: (For `type: "prompt"`) The prompt to send to the LLM for evaluation
  * `timeout`: (Optional) How long a hook should run, in seconds, before canceling that specific hook

For events like `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, and `SubagentStop`
that don't use matchers, you can omit the matcher field:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/path/to/prompt-validator.py"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Project-Specific Hook Scripts

You can use the environment variable `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` (only available when
Claude Code spawns the hook command) to reference scripts stored in your project,
ensuring they work regardless of Claude's current directory:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "\"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\"/.claude/hooks/check-style.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Plugin hooks

[Plugins](/en/plugins) can provide hooks that integrate seamlessly with your user and project hooks. Plugin hooks are automatically merged with your configuration when plugins are enabled.

**How plugin hooks work**:

* Plugin hooks are defined in the plugin's `hooks/hooks.json` file or in a file given by a custom path to the `hooks` field.
* When a plugin is enabled, its hooks are merged with user and project hooks
* Multiple hooks from different sources can respond to the same event
* Plugin hooks use the `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` environment variable to reference plugin files

**Example plugin hook configuration**:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "description": "Automatic code formatting",
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/format.sh",
            "timeout": 30
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

<Note>
  Plugin hooks use the same format as regular hooks with an optional `description` field to explain the hook's purpose.
</Note>

<Note>
  Plugin hooks run alongside your custom hooks. If multiple hooks match an event, they all execute in parallel.
</Note>

**Environment variables for plugins**:

* `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`: Absolute path to the plugin directory
* `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}`: Project root directory (same as for project hooks)
* All standard environment variables are available

See the [plugin components reference](/en/plugins-reference#hooks) for details on creating plugin hooks.

## Prompt-Based Hooks

In addition to bash command hooks (`type: "command"`), Claude Code supports prompt-based hooks (`type: "prompt"`) that use an LLM to evaluate whether to allow or block an action. Prompt-based hooks are currently only supported for `Stop` and `SubagentStop` hooks, where they enable intelligent, context-aware decisions.

### How prompt-based hooks work

Instead of executing a bash command, prompt-based hooks:

1. Send the hook input and your prompt to a fast LLM (Haiku)
2. The LLM responds with structured JSON containing a decision
3. Claude Code processes the decision automatically

### Configuration

```json  theme={null}
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "prompt",
            "prompt": "Evaluate if Claude should stop: $ARGUMENTS. Check if all tasks are complete."
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Fields:**

* `type`: Must be `"prompt"`
* `prompt`: The prompt text to send to the LLM
  * Use `$ARGUMENTS` as a placeholder for the hook input JSON
  * If `$ARGUMENTS` is not present, input JSON is appended to the prompt
* `timeout`: (Optional) Timeout in seconds (default: 30 seconds)

### Response schema

The LLM must respond with JSON containing:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "decision": "approve" | "block",
  "reason": "Explanation for the decision",
  "continue": false,  // Optional: stops Claude entirely
  "stopReason": "Message shown to user",  // Optional: custom stop message
  "systemMessage": "Warning or context"  // Optional: shown to user
}
```

**Response fields:**

* `decision`: `"approve"` allows the action, `"block"` prevents it
* `reason`: Explanation shown to Claude when decision is `"block"`
* `continue`: (Optional) If `false`, stops Claude's execution entirely
* `stopReason`: (Optional) Message shown when `continue` is false
* `systemMessage`: (Optional) Additional message shown to the user

### Supported hook events

Prompt-based hooks work with any hook event, but are most useful for:

* **Stop**: Intelligently decide if Claude should continue working
* **SubagentStop**: Evaluate if a subagent has completed its task
* **UserPromptSubmit**: Validate user prompts with LLM assistance
* **PreToolUse**: Make context-aware permission decisions
* **PermissionRequest**: Intelligently allow or deny permission dialogs

### Example: Intelligent Stop hook

```json  theme={null}
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "prompt",
            "prompt": "You are evaluating whether Claude should stop working. Context: $ARGUMENTS\n\nAnalyze the conversation and determine if:\n1. All user-requested tasks are complete\n2. Any errors need to be addressed\n3. Follow-up work is needed\n\nRespond with JSON: {\"decision\": \"approve\" or \"block\", \"reason\": \"your explanation\"}",
            "timeout": 30
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Example: SubagentStop with custom logic

```json  theme={null}
{
  "hooks": {
    "SubagentStop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "prompt",
            "prompt": "Evaluate if this subagent should stop. Input: $ARGUMENTS\n\nCheck if:\n- The subagent completed its assigned task\n- Any errors occurred that need fixing\n- Additional context gathering is needed\n\nReturn: {\"decision\": \"approve\" or \"block\", \"reason\": \"explanation\"}"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Comparison with bash command hooks

| Feature               | Bash Command Hooks      | Prompt-Based Hooks             |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Execution**         | Runs bash script        | Queries LLM                    |
| **Decision logic**    | You implement in code   | LLM evaluates context          |
| **Setup complexity**  | Requires script file    | Configure prompt               |
| **Context awareness** | Limited to script logic | Natural language understanding |
| **Performance**       | Fast (local execution)  | Slower (API call)              |
| **Use case**          | Deterministic rules     | Context-aware decisions        |

### Best practices

* **Be specific in prompts**: Clearly state what you want the LLM to evaluate
* **Include decision criteria**: List the factors the LLM should consider
* **Test your prompts**: Verify the LLM makes correct decisions for your use cases
* **Set appropriate timeouts**: Default is 30 seconds, adjust if needed
* **Use for complex decisions**: Bash hooks are better for simple, deterministic rules

See the [plugin components reference](/en/plugins-reference#hooks) for details on creating plugin hooks.

## Hook Events

### PreToolUse

Runs after Claude creates tool parameters and before processing the tool call.

**Common matchers:**

* `Task` - Subagent tasks (see [subagents documentation](/en/sub-agents))
* `Bash` - Shell commands
* `Glob` - File pattern matching
* `Grep` - Content search
* `Read` - File reading
* `Edit` - File editing
* `Write` - File writing
* `WebFetch`, `WebSearch` - Web operations

Use [PreToolUse decision control](#pretooluse-decision-control) to allow, deny, or ask for permission to use the tool.

### PermissionRequest

Runs when the user is shown a permission dialog.
Use [PermissionRequest decision control](#permissionrequest-decision-control) to allow or deny on behalf of the user.

Recognizes the same matcher values as PreToolUse.

### PostToolUse

Runs immediately after a tool completes successfully.

Recognizes the same matcher values as PreToolUse.

### Notification

Runs when Claude Code sends notifications. Supports matchers to filter by notification type.

**Common matchers:**

* `permission_prompt` - Permission requests from Claude Code
* `idle_prompt` - When Claude is waiting for user input (after 60+ seconds of idle time)
* `auth_success` - Authentication success notifications
* `elicitation_dialog` - When Claude Code needs input for MCP tool elicitation

You can use matchers to run different hooks for different notification types, or omit the matcher to run hooks for all notifications.

**Example: Different notifications for different types**

```json  theme={null}
{
  "hooks": {
    "Notification": [
      {
        "matcher": "permission_prompt",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/path/to/permission-alert.sh"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "matcher": "idle_prompt",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/path/to/idle-notification.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### UserPromptSubmit

Runs when the user submits a prompt, before Claude processes it. This allows you
to add additional context based on the prompt/conversation, validate prompts, or
block certain types of prompts.

### Stop

Runs when the main Claude Code agent has finished responding. Does not run if
the stoppage occurred due to a user interrupt.

### SubagentStop

Runs when a Claude Code subagent (Task tool call) has finished responding.

### PreCompact

Runs before Claude Code is about to run a compact operation.

**Matchers:**

* `manual` - Invoked from `/compact`
* `auto` - Invoked from auto-compact (due to full context window)

### SessionStart

Runs when Claude Code starts a new session or resumes an existing session (which
currently does start a new session under the hood). Useful for loading in
development context like existing issues or recent changes to your codebase, installing dependencies, or setting up environment variables.

**Matchers:**

* `startup` - Invoked from startup
* `resume` - Invoked from `--resume`, `--continue`, or `/resume`
* `clear` - Invoked from `/clear`
* `compact` - Invoked from auto or manual compact.

#### Persisting environment variables

SessionStart hooks have access to the `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` environment variable, which provides a file path where you can persist environment variables for subsequent bash commands.

**Example: Setting individual environment variables**

```bash  theme={null}
#!/bin/bash

if [ -n "$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE" ]; then
  echo 'export NODE_ENV=production' >> "$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE"
  echo 'export API_KEY=your-api-key' >> "$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE"
  echo 'export PATH="$PATH:./node_modules/.bin"' >> "$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE"
fi

exit 0
```

**Example: Persisting all environment changes from the hook**

When your setup modifies the environment (for example, `nvm use`), capture and persist all changes by diffing the environment:

```bash  theme={null}
#!/bin/bash

ENV_BEFORE=$(export -p | sort)

# Run your setup commands that modify the environment
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
nvm use 20

if [ -n "$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE" ]; then
  ENV_AFTER=$(export -p | sort)
  comm -13 <(echo "$ENV_BEFORE") <(echo "$ENV_AFTER") >> "$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE"
fi

exit 0
```

Any variables written to this file will be available in all subsequent bash commands that Claude Code executes during the session.

<Note>
  `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` is only available for SessionStart hooks. Other hook types do not have access to this variable.
</Note>

### SessionEnd

Runs when a Claude Code session ends. Useful for cleanup tasks, logging session
statistics, or saving session state.

The `reason` field in the hook input will be one of:

* `clear` - Session cleared with /clear command
* `logout` - User logged out
* `prompt_input_exit` - User exited while prompt input was visible
* `other` - Other exit reasons

## Hook Input

Hooks receive JSON data via stdin containing session information and
event-specific data:

```typescript  theme={null}
{
  // Common fields
  session_id: string
  transcript_path: string  // Path to conversation JSON
  cwd: string              // The current working directory when the hook is invoked
  permission_mode: string  // Current permission mode: "default", "plan", "acceptEdits", or "bypassPermissions"

  // Event-specific fields
  hook_event_name: string
  ...
}
```

### PreToolUse Input

The exact schema for `tool_input` depends on the tool.

```json  theme={null}
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "/Users/.../.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
  "cwd": "/Users/...",
  "permission_mode": "default",
  "hook_event_name": "PreToolUse",
  "tool_name": "Write",
  "tool_input": {
    "file_path": "/path/to/file.txt",
    "content": "file content"
  },
  "tool_use_id": "toolu_01ABC123..."
}
```

### PostToolUse Input

The exact schema for `tool_input` and `tool_response` depends on the tool.

```json  theme={null}
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "/Users/.../.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
  "cwd": "/Users/...",
  "permission_mode": "default",
  "hook_event_name": "PostToolUse",
  "tool_name": "Write",
  "tool_input": {
    "file_path": "/path/to/file.txt",
    "content": "file content"
  },
  "tool_response": {
    "filePath": "/path/to/file.txt",
    "success": true
  },
  "tool_use_id": "toolu_01ABC123..."
}
```

### Notification Input

```json  theme={null}
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "/Users/.../.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
  "cwd": "/Users/...",
  "permission_mode": "default",
  "hook_event_name": "Notification",
  "message": "Claude needs your permission to use Bash",
  "notification_type": "permission_prompt"
}
```

### UserPromptSubmit Input

```json  theme={null}
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "/Users/.../.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
  "cwd": "/Users/...",
  "permission_mode": "default",
  "hook_event_name": "UserPromptSubmit",
  "prompt": "Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number"
}
```

### Stop and SubagentStop Input

`stop_hook_active` is true when Claude Code is already continuing as a result of
a stop hook. Check this value or process the transcript to prevent Claude Code
from running indefinitely.

```json  theme={null}
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "~/.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
  "permission_mode": "default",
  "hook_event_name": "Stop",
  "stop_hook_active": true
}
```

### PreCompact Input

For `manual`, `custom_instructions` comes from what the user passes into
`/compact`. For `auto`, `custom_instructions` is empty.

```json  theme={null}
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "~/.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
  "permission_mode": "default",
  "hook_event_name": "PreCompact",
  "trigger": "manual",
  "custom_instructions": ""
}
```

### SessionStart Input

```json  theme={null}
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "~/.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
  "permission_mode": "default",
  "hook_event_name": "SessionStart",
  "source": "startup"
}
```

### SessionEnd Input

```json  theme={null}
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "~/.claude/projects/.../00893aaf-19fa-41d2-8238-13269b9b3ca0.jsonl",
  "cwd": "/Users/...",
  "permission_mode": "default",
  "hook_event_name": "SessionEnd",
  "reason": "exit"
}
```

## Hook Output

There are two mutually exclusive ways for hooks to return output back to Claude Code. The output
communicates whether to block and any feedback that should be shown to Claude
and the user.

### Simple: Exit Code

Hooks communicate status through exit codes, stdout, and stderr:

* **Exit code 0**: Success. `stdout` is shown to the user in verbose mode
  (ctrl+o), except for `UserPromptSubmit` and `SessionStart`, where stdout is
  added to the context. JSON output in `stdout` is parsed for structured control
  (see [Advanced: JSON Output](#advanced-json-output)).
* **Exit code 2**: Blocking error. Only `stderr` is used as the error message
  and fed back to Claude. The format is `[command]: {stderr}`. JSON in `stdout`
  is **not** processed for exit code 2. See per-hook-event behavior below.
* **Other exit codes**: Non-blocking error. `stderr` is shown to the user in verbose mode (ctrl+o) with
  format `Failed with non-blocking status code: {stderr}`. If `stderr` is empty,
  it shows `No stderr output`. Execution continues.

<Warning>
  Reminder: Claude Code does not see stdout if the exit code is 0, except for
  the `UserPromptSubmit` hook where stdout is injected as context.
</Warning>

#### Exit Code 2 Behavior

| Hook Event          | Behavior                                                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `PreToolUse`        | Blocks the tool call, shows stderr to Claude                       |
| `PermissionRequest` | Denies the permission, shows stderr to Claude                      |
| `PostToolUse`       | Shows stderr to Claude (tool already ran)                          |
| `Notification`      | N/A, shows stderr to user only                                     |
| `UserPromptSubmit`  | Blocks prompt processing, erases prompt, shows stderr to user only |
| `Stop`              | Blocks stoppage, shows stderr to Claude                            |
| `SubagentStop`      | Blocks stoppage, shows stderr to Claude subagent                   |
| `PreCompact`        | N/A, shows stderr to user only                                     |
| `SessionStart`      | N/A, shows stderr to user only                                     |
| `SessionEnd`        | N/A, shows stderr to user only                                     |

### Advanced: JSON Output

Hooks can return structured JSON in `stdout` for more sophisticated control.

<Warning>
  JSON output is only processed when the hook exits with code 0. If your hook
  exits with code 2 (blocking error), `stderr` text is used directly—any JSON in `stdout`
  is ignored. For other non-zero exit codes, only `stderr` is shown to the user in verbose mode (ctrl+o).
</Warning>

#### Common JSON Fields

All hook types can include these optional fields:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "continue": true, // Whether Claude should continue after hook execution (default: true)
  "stopReason": "string", // Message shown when continue is false

  "suppressOutput": true, // Hide stdout from transcript mode (default: false)
  "systemMessage": "string" // Optional warning message shown to the user
}
```

If `continue` is false, Claude stops processing after the hooks run.

* For `PreToolUse`, this is different from `"permissionDecision": "deny"`, which
  only blocks a specific tool call and provides automatic feedback to Claude.
* For `PostToolUse`, this is different from `"decision": "block"`, which
  provides automated feedback to Claude.
* For `UserPromptSubmit`, this prevents the prompt from being processed.
* For `Stop` and `SubagentStop`, this takes precedence over any
  `"decision": "block"` output.
* In all cases, `"continue" = false` takes precedence over any
  `"decision": "block"` output.

`stopReason` accompanies `continue` with a reason shown to the user, not shown
to Claude.

#### `PreToolUse` Decision Control

`PreToolUse` hooks can control whether a tool call proceeds.

* `"allow"` bypasses the permission system. `permissionDecisionReason` is shown
  to the user but not to Claude.
* `"deny"` prevents the tool call from executing. `permissionDecisionReason` is
  shown to Claude.
* `"ask"` asks the user to confirm the tool call in the UI.
  `permissionDecisionReason` is shown to the user but not to Claude.

Additionally, hooks can modify tool inputs before execution using `updatedInput`:

* `updatedInput` allows you to modify the tool's input parameters before the tool executes.
* This is most useful with `"permissionDecision": "allow"` to modify and approve tool calls.

```json  theme={null}
{
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "PreToolUse",
    "permissionDecision": "allow"
    "permissionDecisionReason": "My reason here",
    "updatedInput": {
      "field_to_modify": "new value"
    }
  }
}
```

<Note>
  The `decision` and `reason` fields are deprecated for PreToolUse hooks.
  Use `hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision` and
  `hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecisionReason` instead. The deprecated fields
  `"approve"` and `"block"` map to `"allow"` and `"deny"` respectively.
</Note>

#### `PermissionRequest` Decision Control

`PermissionRequest` hooks can allow or deny permission requests shown to the user.

* For `"behavior": "allow"` you can also optionally pass in an `"updatedInput"` that modifies the tool's input parameters before the tool executes.
* For `"behavior": "deny"` you can also optionally pass in a `"message"` string that tells the model why the permission was denied, and a boolean `"interrupt"` which will stop Claude.

```json  theme={null}
{
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "PermissionRequest",
    "decision": {
      "behavior": "allow",
      "updatedInput": {
        "command": "npm run lint"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### `PostToolUse` Decision Control

`PostToolUse` hooks can provide feedback to Claude after tool execution.

* `"block"` automatically prompts Claude with `reason`.
* `undefined` does nothing. `reason` is ignored.
* `"hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext"` adds context for Claude to consider.

```json  theme={null}
{
  "decision": "block" | undefined,
  "reason": "Explanation for decision",
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "PostToolUse",
    "additionalContext": "Additional information for Claude"
  }
}
```

#### `UserPromptSubmit` Decision Control

`UserPromptSubmit` hooks can control whether a user prompt is processed and add context.

**Adding context (exit code 0):**
There are two ways to add context to the conversation:

1. **Plain text stdout** (simpler): Any non-JSON text written to stdout is added
   as context. This is the easiest way to inject information.

2. **JSON with `additionalContext`** (structured): Use the JSON format below for
   more control. The `additionalContext` field is added as context.

Both methods work with exit code 0. Plain stdout is shown as hook output in
the transcript; `additionalContext` is added more discretely.

**Blocking prompts:**

* `"decision": "block"` prevents the prompt from being processed. The submitted
  prompt is erased from context. `"reason"` is shown to the user but not added
  to context.
* `"decision": undefined` (or omitted) allows the prompt to proceed normally.

```json  theme={null}
{
  "decision": "block" | undefined,
  "reason": "Explanation for decision",
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "UserPromptSubmit",
    "additionalContext": "My additional context here"
  }
}
```

<Note>
  The JSON format isn't required for simple use cases. To add context, you can print plain text to stdout with exit code 0. Use JSON when you need to
  block prompts or want more structured control.
</Note>

#### `Stop`/`SubagentStop` Decision Control

`Stop` and `SubagentStop` hooks can control whether Claude must continue.

* `"block"` prevents Claude from stopping. You must populate `reason` for Claude
  to know how to proceed.
* `undefined` allows Claude to stop. `reason` is ignored.

```json  theme={null}
{
  "decision": "block" | undefined,
  "reason": "Must be provided when Claude is blocked from stopping"
}
```

#### `SessionStart` Decision Control

`SessionStart` hooks allow you to load in context at the start of a session.

* `"hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext"` adds the string to the context.
* Multiple hooks' `additionalContext` values are concatenated.

```json  theme={null}
{
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "SessionStart",
    "additionalContext": "My additional context here"
  }
}
```

#### `SessionEnd` Decision Control

`SessionEnd` hooks run when a session ends. They cannot block session termination
but can perform cleanup tasks.

#### Exit Code Example: Bash Command Validation

```python  theme={null}
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import json
import re
import sys

# Define validation rules as a list of (regex pattern, message) tuples
VALIDATION_RULES = [
    (
        r"\bgrep\b(?!.*\|)",
        "Use 'rg' (ripgrep) instead of 'grep' for better performance and features",
    ),
    (
        r"\bfind\s+\S+\s+-name\b",
        "Use 'rg --files | rg pattern' or 'rg --files -g pattern' instead of 'find -name' for better performance",
    ),
]


def validate_command(command: str) -> list[str]:
    issues = []
    for pattern, message in VALIDATION_RULES:
        if re.search(pattern, command):
            issues.append(message)
    return issues


try:
    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)
except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
    print(f"Error: Invalid JSON input: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
    sys.exit(1)

tool_name = input_data.get("tool_name", "")
tool_input = input_data.get("tool_input", {})
command = tool_input.get("command", "")

if tool_name != "Bash" or not command:
    sys.exit(1)

# Validate the command
issues = validate_command(command)

if issues:
    for message in issues:
        print(f"• {message}", file=sys.stderr)
    # Exit code 2 blocks tool call and shows stderr to Claude
    sys.exit(2)
```

#### JSON Output Example: UserPromptSubmit to Add Context and Validation

<Note>
  For `UserPromptSubmit` hooks, you can inject context using either method:

  * **Plain text stdout** with exit code 0: Simplest approach, prints text
  * **JSON output** with exit code 0: Use `"decision": "block"` to reject prompts,
    or `additionalContext` for structured context injection

  Remember: Exit code 2 only uses `stderr` for the error message. To block using
  JSON (with a custom reason), use `"decision": "block"` with exit code 0.
</Note>

```python  theme={null}
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import json
import sys
import re
import datetime

# Load input from stdin
try:
    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)
except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
    print(f"Error: Invalid JSON input: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
    sys.exit(1)

prompt = input_data.get("prompt", "")

# Check for sensitive patterns
sensitive_patterns = [
    (r"(?i)\b(password|secret|key|token)\s*[:=]", "Prompt contains potential secrets"),
]

for pattern, message in sensitive_patterns:
    if re.search(pattern, prompt):
        # Use JSON output to block with a specific reason
        output = {
            "decision": "block",
            "reason": f"Security policy violation: {message}. Please rephrase your request without sensitive information."
        }
        print(json.dumps(output))
        sys.exit(0)

# Add current time to context
context = f"Current time: {datetime.datetime.now()}"
print(context)

"""
The following is also equivalent:
print(json.dumps({
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "UserPromptSubmit",
    "additionalContext": context,
  },
}))
"""

# Allow the prompt to proceed with the additional context
sys.exit(0)
```

#### JSON Output Example: PreToolUse with Approval

```python  theme={null}
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import json
import sys

# Load input from stdin
try:
    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)
except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
    print(f"Error: Invalid JSON input: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
    sys.exit(1)

tool_name = input_data.get("tool_name", "")
tool_input = input_data.get("tool_input", {})

# Example: Auto-approve file reads for documentation files
if tool_name == "Read":
    file_path = tool_input.get("file_path", "")
    if file_path.endswith((".md", ".mdx", ".txt", ".json")):
        # Use JSON output to auto-approve the tool call
        output = {
            "decision": "approve",
            "reason": "Documentation file auto-approved",
            "suppressOutput": True  # Don't show in verbose mode
        }
        print(json.dumps(output))
        sys.exit(0)

# For other cases, let the normal permission flow proceed
sys.exit(0)
```

## Working with MCP Tools

Claude Code hooks work seamlessly with
[Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools](/en/mcp). When MCP servers
provide tools, they appear with a special naming pattern that you can match in
your hooks.

### MCP Tool Naming

MCP tools follow the pattern `mcp__<server>__<tool>`, for example:

* `mcp__memory__create_entities` - Memory server's create entities tool
* `mcp__filesystem__read_file` - Filesystem server's read file tool
* `mcp__github__search_repositories` - GitHub server's search tool

### Configuring Hooks for MCP Tools

You can target specific MCP tools or entire MCP servers:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "mcp__memory__.*",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "echo 'Memory operation initiated' >> ~/mcp-operations.log"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "matcher": "mcp__.*__write.*",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/home/user/scripts/validate-mcp-write.py"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Examples

<Tip>
  For practical examples including code formatting, notifications, and file protection, see [More Examples](/en/hooks-guide#more-examples) in the get started guide.
</Tip>

## Security Considerations

### Disclaimer

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**: Claude Code hooks execute arbitrary shell commands on
your system automatically. By using hooks, you acknowledge that:

* You are solely responsible for the commands you configure
* Hooks can modify, delete, or access any files your user account can access
* Malicious or poorly written hooks can cause data loss or system damage
* Anthropic provides no warranty and assumes no liability for any damages
  resulting from hook usage
* You should thoroughly test hooks in a safe environment before production use

Always review and understand any hook commands before adding them to your
configuration.

### Security Best Practices

Here are some key practices for writing more secure hooks:

1. **Validate and sanitize inputs** - Never trust input data blindly
2. **Always quote shell variables** - Use `"$VAR"` not `$VAR`
3. **Block path traversal** - Check for `..` in file paths
4. **Use absolute paths** - Specify full paths for scripts (use
   "\$CLAUDE\_PROJECT\_DIR" for the project path)
5. **Skip sensitive files** - Avoid `.env`, `.git/`, keys, etc.

### Configuration Safety

Direct edits to hooks in settings files don't take effect immediately. Claude
Code:

1. Captures a snapshot of hooks at startup
2. Uses this snapshot throughout the session
3. Warns if hooks are modified externally
4. Requires review in `/hooks` menu for changes to apply

This prevents malicious hook modifications from affecting your current session.

## Hook Execution Details

* **Timeout**: 60-second execution limit by default, configurable per command.
  * A timeout for an individual command does not affect the other commands.
* **Parallelization**: All matching hooks run in parallel
* **Deduplication**: Multiple identical hook commands are deduplicated automatically
* **Environment**: Runs in current directory with Claude Code's environment
  * The `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` environment variable is available and contains the
    absolute path to the project root directory (where Claude Code was started)
  * The `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE` environment variable indicates whether the hook is running in a remote (web) environment (`"true"`) or local CLI environment (not set or empty). Use this to run different logic based on execution context.
* **Input**: JSON via stdin
* **Output**:
  * PreToolUse/PermissionRequest/PostToolUse/Stop/SubagentStop: Progress shown in verbose mode (ctrl+o)
  * Notification/SessionEnd: Logged to debug only (`--debug`)
  * UserPromptSubmit/SessionStart: stdout added as context for Claude

## Debugging

### Basic Troubleshooting

If your hooks aren't working:

1. **Check configuration** - Run `/hooks` to see if your hook is registered
2. **Verify syntax** - Ensure your JSON settings are valid
3. **Test commands** - Run hook commands manually first
4. **Check permissions** - Make sure scripts are executable
5. **Review logs** - Use `claude --debug` to see hook execution details

Common issues:

* **Quotes not escaped** - Use `\"` inside JSON strings
* **Wrong matcher** - Check tool names match exactly (case-sensitive)
* **Command not found** - Use full paths for scripts

### Advanced Debugging

For complex hook issues:

1. **Inspect hook execution** - Use `claude --debug` to see detailed hook
   execution
2. **Validate JSON schemas** - Test hook input/output with external tools
3. **Check environment variables** - Verify Claude Code's environment is correct
4. **Test edge cases** - Try hooks with unusual file paths or inputs
5. **Monitor system resources** - Check for resource exhaustion during hook
   execution
6. **Use structured logging** - Implement logging in your hook scripts

### Debug Output Example

Use `claude --debug` to see hook execution details:

```
[DEBUG] Executing hooks for PostToolUse:Write
[DEBUG] Getting matching hook commands for PostToolUse with query: Write
[DEBUG] Found 1 hook matchers in settings
[DEBUG] Matched 1 hooks for query "Write"
[DEBUG] Found 1 hook commands to execute
[DEBUG] Executing hook command: <Your command> with timeout 60000ms
[DEBUG] Hook command completed with status 0: <Your stdout>
```

Progress messages appear in verbose mode (ctrl+o) showing:

* Which hook is running
* Command being executed
* Success/failure status
* Output or error messages

# Plugins reference

> Complete technical reference for Claude Code plugin system, including schemas, CLI commands, and component specifications.

<Tip>
  Looking to install plugins? See [Discover and install plugins](/en/discover-plugins). For creating plugins, see [Plugins](/en/plugins). For distributing plugins, see [Plugin marketplaces](/en/plugin-marketplaces).
</Tip>

This reference provides complete technical specifications for the Claude Code plugin system, including component schemas, CLI commands, and development tools.

## Plugin components reference

This section documents the five types of components that plugins can provide.

### Commands

Plugins add custom slash commands that integrate seamlessly with Claude Code's command system.

**Location**: `commands/` directory in plugin root

**File format**: Markdown files with frontmatter

For complete details on plugin command structure, invocation patterns, and features, see [Plugin commands](/en/slash-commands#plugin-commands).

### Agents

Plugins can provide specialized subagents for specific tasks that Claude can invoke automatically when appropriate.

**Location**: `agents/` directory in plugin root

**File format**: Markdown files describing agent capabilities

**Agent structure**:

```markdown  theme={null}
---
description: What this agent specializes in
capabilities: ["task1", "task2", "task3"]
---

# Agent Name

Detailed description of the agent's role, expertise, and when Claude should invoke it.

## Capabilities
- Specific task the agent excels at
- Another specialized capability
- When to use this agent vs others

## Context and examples
Provide examples of when this agent should be used and what kinds of problems it solves.
```

**Integration points**:

* Agents appear in the `/agents` interface
* Claude can invoke agents automatically based on task context
* Agents can be invoked manually by users
* Plugin agents work alongside built-in Claude agents

### Skills

Plugins can provide Agent Skills that extend Claude's capabilities. Skills are model-invoked—Claude autonomously decides when to use them based on the task context.

**Location**: `skills/` directory in plugin root

**File format**: Directories containing `SKILL.md` files with frontmatter

**Skill structure**:

```
skills/
├── pdf-processor/
│   ├── SKILL.md
│   ├── reference.md (optional)
│   └── scripts/ (optional)
└── code-reviewer/
    └── SKILL.md
```

**Integration behavior**:

* Plugin Skills are automatically discovered when the plugin is installed
* Claude autonomously invokes Skills based on matching task context
* Skills can include supporting files alongside SKILL.md

For SKILL.md format and complete Skill authoring guidance, see:

* [Use Skills in Claude Code](/en/skills)
* [Agent Skills overview](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview#skill-structure)

### Hooks

Plugins can provide event handlers that respond to Claude Code events automatically.

**Location**: `hooks/hooks.json` in plugin root, or inline in plugin.json

**Format**: JSON configuration with event matchers and actions

**Hook configuration**:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/format-code.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Available events**:

* `PreToolUse`: Before Claude uses any tool
* `PostToolUse`: After Claude successfully uses any tool
* `PostToolUseFailure`: After Claude tool execution fails
* `PermissionRequest`: When a permission dialog is shown
* `UserPromptSubmit`: When user submits a prompt
* `Notification`: When Claude Code sends notifications
* `Stop`: When Claude attempts to stop
* `SubagentStart`: When a subagent is started
* `SubagentStop`: When a subagent attempts to stop
* `SessionStart`: At the beginning of sessions
* `SessionEnd`: At the end of sessions
* `PreCompact`: Before conversation history is compacted

**Hook types**:

* `command`: Execute shell commands or scripts
* `prompt`: Evaluate a prompt with an LLM (uses `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder for context)
* `agent`: Run an agentic verifier with tools for complex verification tasks

### MCP servers

Plugins can bundle Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to connect Claude Code with external tools and services.

**Location**: `.mcp.json` in plugin root, or inline in plugin.json

**Format**: Standard MCP server configuration

**MCP server configuration**:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "plugin-database": {
      "command": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/servers/db-server",
      "args": ["--config", "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/config.json"],
      "env": {
        "DB_PATH": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/data"
      }
    },
    "plugin-api-client": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@company/mcp-server", "--plugin-mode"],
      "cwd": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"
    }
  }
}
```

**Integration behavior**:

* Plugin MCP servers start automatically when the plugin is enabled
* Servers appear as standard MCP tools in Claude's toolkit
* Server capabilities integrate seamlessly with Claude's existing tools
* Plugin servers can be configured independently of user MCP servers

### LSP servers

<Tip>
  Looking to use LSP plugins? Install them from the official marketplace—search for "lsp" in the `/plugin` Discover tab. This section documents how to create LSP plugins for languages not covered by the official marketplace.
</Tip>

Plugins can provide [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) (LSP) servers to give Claude real-time code intelligence while working on your codebase.

LSP integration provides:

* **Instant diagnostics**: Claude sees errors and warnings immediately after each edit
* **Code navigation**: go to definition, find references, and hover information
* **Language awareness**: type information and documentation for code symbols

**Location**: `.lsp.json` in plugin root, or inline in `plugin.json`

**Format**: JSON configuration mapping language server names to their configurations

**`.lsp.json` file format**:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "go": {
    "command": "gopls",
    "args": ["serve"],
    "extensionToLanguage": {
      ".go": "go"
    }
  }
}
```

**Inline in `plugin.json`**:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "lspServers": {
    "go": {
      "command": "gopls",
      "args": ["serve"],
      "extensionToLanguage": {
        ".go": "go"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Required fields:**

| Field                 | Description                                  |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| `command`             | The LSP binary to execute (must be in PATH)  |
| `extensionToLanguage` | Maps file extensions to language identifiers |

**Optional fields:**

| Field                   | Description                                               |
| :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| `args`                  | Command-line arguments for the LSP server                 |
| `transport`             | Communication transport: `stdio` (default) or `socket`    |
| `env`                   | Environment variables to set when starting the server     |
| `initializationOptions` | Options passed to the server during initialization        |
| `settings`              | Settings passed via `workspace/didChangeConfiguration`    |
| `workspaceFolder`       | Workspace folder path for the server                      |
| `startupTimeout`        | Max time to wait for server startup (milliseconds)        |
| `shutdownTimeout`       | Max time to wait for graceful shutdown (milliseconds)     |
| `restartOnCrash`        | Whether to automatically restart the server if it crashes |
| `maxRestarts`           | Maximum number of restart attempts before giving up       |
| `loggingConfig`         | Debug logging configuration (see below)                   |

**Debug logging configuration:**

The `loggingConfig` field enables verbose LSP logging when users pass `--enable-lsp-logging`. This helps debug language server issues without impacting normal operation.

```json  theme={null}
"loggingConfig": {
  "args": ["--log-level", "4"],
  "env": {
    "TSS_LOG": "-level verbose -file ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_LSP_LOG_FILE}"
  }
}
```

| Field  | Description                                                        |
| :----- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `args` | Additional command-line arguments appended when logging is enabled |
| `env`  | Additional environment variables merged when logging is enabled    |

The `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_LSP_LOG_FILE}` variable expands to the log file path. Logs are written to `~/.claude/debug/`.

<Warning>
  **You must install the language server binary separately.** LSP plugins configure how Claude Code connects to a language server, but they don't include the server itself. If you see `Executable not found in $PATH` in the `/plugin` Errors tab, install the required binary for your language.
</Warning>

**Available LSP plugins:**

| Plugin           | Language server            | Install command                                                                            |
| :--------------- | :------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pyright-lsp`    | Pyright (Python)           | `pip install pyright` or `npm install -g pyright`                                          |
| `typescript-lsp` | TypeScript Language Server | `npm install -g typescript-language-server typescript`                                     |
| `rust-lsp`       | rust-analyzer              | [See rust-analyzer installation](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/manual.html#installation) |

Install the language server first, then install the plugin from the marketplace.

## Plugin installation scopes

When you install a plugin, you choose a **scope** that determines where the plugin is available and who else can use it:

| Scope     | Settings file                 | Use case                                                 |
| :-------- | :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- |
| `user`    | `~/.claude/settings.json`     | Personal plugins available across all projects (default) |
| `project` | `.claude/settings.json`       | Team plugins shared via version control                  |
| `local`   | `.claude/settings.local.json` | Project-specific plugins, gitignored                     |
| `managed` | `managed-settings.json`       | Enterprise-managed plugins (read-only, update only)      |

Plugins use the same scope system as other Claude Code configurations. For installation instructions and scope flags, see [Install plugins](/en/discover-plugins#install-plugins). For a complete explanation of scopes, see [Configuration scopes](/en/settings#configuration-scopes).

### Path behavior rules

**Important**: Custom paths supplement default directories - they don't replace them.

* If `commands/` exists, it's loaded in addition to custom command paths
* All paths must be relative to plugin root and start with `./`
* Commands from custom paths use the same naming and namespacing rules
* Multiple paths can be specified as arrays for flexibility

**Path examples**:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "commands": [
    "./specialized/deploy.md",
    "./utilities/batch-process.md"
  ],
  "agents": [
    "./custom-agents/reviewer.md",
    "./custom-agents/tester.md"
  ]
}
```

### Environment variables

**`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`**: Contains the absolute path to your plugin directory. Use this in hooks, MCP servers, and scripts to ensure correct paths regardless of installation location.

```json  theme={null}
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/process.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

***

## Plugin caching and file resolution

For security and verification purposes, Claude Code copies plugins to a cache directory rather than using them in-place. Understanding this behavior is important when developing plugins that reference external files.

### How plugin caching works

When you install a plugin, Claude Code copies the plugin files to a cache directory:

* **For marketplace plugins with relative paths**: The path specified in the `source` field is copied recursively. For example, if your marketplace entry specifies `"source": "./plugins/my-plugin"`, the entire `./plugins` directory is copied.
* **For plugins with `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`**: The implicit root directory (the directory containing `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`) is copied recursively.

### Path traversal limitations

Plugins cannot reference files outside their copied directory structure. Paths that traverse outside the plugin root (such as `../shared-utils`) will not work after installation because those external files are not copied to the cache.

### Working with external dependencies

If your plugin needs to access files outside its directory, you have two options:

**Option 1: Use symlinks**

Create symbolic links to external files within your plugin directory. Symlinks are honored during the copy process:

```bash  theme={null}
# Inside your plugin directory
ln -s /path/to/shared-utils ./shared-utils
```

The symlinked content will be copied into the plugin cache.

**Option 2: Restructure your marketplace**

Set the plugin path to a parent directory that contains all required files, then provide the rest of the plugin manifest directly in the marketplace entry:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "source": "./",
  "description": "Plugin that needs root-level access",
  "commands": ["./plugins/my-plugin/commands/"],
  "agents": ["./plugins/my-plugin/agents/"],
  "strict": false
}
```

This approach copies the entire marketplace root, giving your plugin access to sibling directories.

<Note>
  Symlinks that point to locations outside the plugin's logical root are followed during copying. This provides flexibility while maintaining the security benefits of the caching system.
</Note>

## Plugin directory structure

### Standard plugin layout

A complete plugin follows this structure:

```
enterprise-plugin/
├── .claude-plugin/           # Metadata directory
│   └── plugin.json          # Required: plugin manifest
├── commands/                 # Default command location
│   ├── status.md
│   └── logs.md
├── agents/                   # Default agent location
│   ├── security-reviewer.md
│   ├── performance-tester.md
│   └── compliance-checker.md
├── skills/                   # Agent Skills
│   ├── code-reviewer/
│   │   └── SKILL.md
│   └── pdf-processor/
│       ├── SKILL.md
│       └── scripts/
├── hooks/                    # Hook configurations
│   ├── hooks.json           # Main hook config
│   └── security-hooks.json  # Additional hooks
├── .mcp.json                # MCP server definitions
├── .lsp.json                # LSP server configurations
├── scripts/                 # Hook and utility scripts
│   ├── security-scan.sh
│   ├── format-code.py
│   └── deploy.js
├── LICENSE                  # License file
└── CHANGELOG.md             # Version history
```

<Warning>
  The `.claude-plugin/` directory contains the `plugin.json` file. All other directories (commands/, agents/, skills/, hooks/) must be at the plugin root, not inside `.claude-plugin/`.
</Warning>

## Debugging and development tools

### Debugging commands

Use `claude --debug` to see plugin loading details:

```bash  theme={null}
claude --debug
```

This shows:

* Which plugins are being loaded
* Any errors in plugin manifests
* Command, agent, and hook registration
* MCP server initialization

### Common issues

| Issue                               | Cause                           | Solution                                                                          |
| :---------------------------------- | :------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Plugin not loading                  | Invalid `plugin.json`           | Validate JSON syntax with `claude plugin validate` or `/plugin validate`          |
| Commands not appearing              | Wrong directory structure       | Ensure `commands/` at root, not in `.claude-plugin/`                              |
| Hooks not firing                    | Script not executable           | Run `chmod +x script.sh`                                                          |
| MCP server fails                    | Missing `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` | Use variable for all plugin paths                                                 |
| Path errors                         | Absolute paths used             | All paths must be relative and start with `./`                                    |
| LSP `Executable not found in $PATH` | Language server not installed   | Install the binary (e.g., `npm install -g typescript-language-server typescript`) |

### Example error messages

**Manifest validation errors**:

* `Invalid JSON syntax: Unexpected token } in JSON at position 142`: check for missing commas, extra commas, or unquoted strings
* `Plugin has an invalid manifest file at .claude-plugin/plugin.json. Validation errors: name: Required`: a required field is missing
* `Plugin has a corrupt manifest file at .claude-plugin/plugin.json. JSON parse error: ...`: JSON syntax error

**Plugin loading errors**:

* `Warning: No commands found in plugin my-plugin custom directory: ./cmds. Expected .md files or SKILL.md in subdirectories.`: command path exists but contains no valid command files
* `Plugin directory not found at path: ./plugins/my-plugin. Check that the marketplace entry has the correct path.`: the `source` path in marketplace.json points to a non-existent directory
* `Plugin my-plugin has conflicting manifests: both plugin.json and marketplace entry specify components.`: remove duplicate component definitions or set `strict: true` in marketplace entry

### Hook troubleshooting

**Hook script not executing**:

1. Check the script is executable: `chmod +x ./scripts/your-script.sh`
2. Verify the shebang line: First line should be `#!/bin/bash` or `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
3. Check the path uses `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`: `"command": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/your-script.sh"`
4. Test the script manually: `./scripts/your-script.sh`

**Hook not triggering on expected events**:

1. Verify the event name is correct (case-sensitive): `PostToolUse`, not `postToolUse`
2. Check the matcher pattern matches your tools: `"matcher": "Write|Edit"` for file operations
3. Confirm the hook type is valid: `command`, `prompt`, or `agent`

### MCP server troubleshooting

**Server not starting**:

1. Check the command exists and is executable
2. Verify all paths use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` variable
3. Check the MCP server logs: `claude --debug` shows initialization errors
4. Test the server manually outside of Claude Code

**Server tools not appearing**:

1. Ensure the server is properly configured in `.mcp.json` or `plugin.json`
2. Verify the server implements the MCP protocol correctly
3. Check for connection timeouts in debug output

### Directory structure mistakes

**Symptoms**: Plugin loads but components (commands, agents, hooks) are missing.

**Correct structure**: Components must be at the plugin root, not inside `.claude-plugin/`. Only `plugin.json` belongs in `.claude-plugin/`.

```
my-plugin/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json      ← Only manifest here
├── commands/            ← At root level
├── agents/              ← At root level
└── hooks/               ← At root level
```

If your components are inside `.claude-plugin/`, move them to the plugin root.

**Debug checklist**:

1. Run `claude --debug` and look for "loading plugin" messages
2. Check that each component directory is listed in the debug output
3. Verify file permissions allow reading the plugin files

***

## Distribution and versioning reference

### Version management

Follow semantic versioning for plugin releases:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "version": "2.1.0"
}
```

**Version format**: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

* **MAJOR**: Breaking changes (incompatible API changes)
* **MINOR**: New features (backward-compatible additions)
* **PATCH**: Bug fixes (backward-compatible fixes)

**Best practices**:

* Start at `1.0.0` for your first stable release
* Update the version in `plugin.json` before distributing changes
* Document changes in a `CHANGELOG.md` file
* Use pre-release versions like `2.0.0-beta.1` for testing

- **agents/** - Specialized agents for that domain
- **commands/** - Tools and workflows specific to that plugin
- **skills/** - Optional modular knowledge packages (progressive disclosure)

Example:

```
plugins/python-development/
├── agents/
│   ├── python-pro.md
│   ├── django-pro.md
│   └── fastapi-pro.md
├── commands/
│   └── python-scaffold.md
└── skills/
    ├── async-python-patterns/
    ├── python-testing-patterns/
    ├── python-packaging/
    ├── python-performance-optimization/
    └── uv-package-manager/
```

## Installation

### Step 1: Add the Marketplace

```bash
/plugin marketplace add wshobson/agents
```

This makes all 67 plugins available for installation, but **does not load any agents or tools** into your context.

### Step 2: Install Specific Plugins

Browse available plugins:

```bash
/plugin
```

Install only the plugins you need:

```bash
/plugin install python-development
/plugin install backend-development
```

Each installed plugin loads **only its specific agents and commands** into Claude's context.

## Plugin Design Principles

### Single Responsibility

- Each plugin does **one thing well** (Unix philosophy)
- Clear, focused purposes (describable in 5-10 words)
- Average plugin size: **3.4 components** (follows Anthropic's 2-8 pattern)

### Minimal Token Usage

- Install only what you need
- Each plugin loads only its specific agents and tools
- No unnecessary resources loaded into context
- Better context efficiency with granular plugins

### Composability

- Mix and match plugins for complex workflows
- Workflow orchestrators compose focused plugins
- Clear boundaries between plugins
- No forced feature bundling

### Hybrid Orchestration Patterns

The plugin ecosystem leverages Sonnet + Haiku orchestration for optimal performance and cost efficiency:

#### Pattern 1: Planning → Execution

```
Sonnet: backend-architect (design API architecture)
  ↓
Haiku: Generate API endpoints following spec
  ↓
Haiku: test-automator (generate comprehensive tests)
  ↓
Sonnet: code-reviewer (architectural review)
```

#### Pattern 2: Reasoning → Action (Incident Response)

```
Sonnet: incident-responder (diagnose issue, create strategy)
  ↓
Haiku: devops-troubleshooter (execute fixes)
  ↓
Haiku: deployment-engineer (deploy hotfix)
  ↓
Haiku: Implement monitoring alerts
```

#### Pattern 3: Complex → Simple (Database Design)

```
Sonnet: database-architect (schema design, technology selection)
  ↓
Haiku: sql-pro (generate migration scripts)
  ↓
Haiku: database-admin (execute migrations)
  ↓
Haiku: database-optimizer (tune query performance)
```

#### Pattern 4: Multi-Agent Workflows

```
Full-Stack Feature Development:
Sonnet: backend-architect + frontend-developer (design components)
  ↓
Haiku: Generate code following designs
  ↓
Haiku: test-automator (unit + integration tests)
  ↓
Sonnet: security-auditor (security review)
  ↓
Haiku: deployment-engineer (CI/CD setup)
  ↓
Haiku: Setup observability stack
```

## Agent Invocation

### Natural Language

Agents can be invoked through natural language when you need Claude to reason about which specialist to use:

```
"Use backend-architect to design the authentication API"
"Have security-auditor scan for OWASP vulnerabilities"
"Get performance-engineer to optimize this database query"
```

### Slash Commands

Many agents are accessible through plugin slash commands for direct invocation:

```bash
/backend-development:feature-development user authentication
/security-scanning:security-sast
/incident-response:smart-fix "memory leak in payment service"
```

## Contributing

To add a new agent:

1. Create `plugins/{plugin-name}/agents/{agent-name}.md`
2. Add frontmatter with name, description, and model assignment
3. Write comprehensive system prompt
4. Update plugin definition in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`

See [Contributing Guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.















# Usage Guide

Complete guide to using agents, slash commands, and multi-agent workflows.

## Overview

The plugin ecosystem provides two primary interfaces:

1. **Slash Commands** - Direct invocation of tools and workflows
2. **Natural Language** - Claude reasons about which agents to use

## Slash Commands

Slash commands are the primary interface for working with agents and workflows. Each plugin provides namespaced commands that you can run directly.

### Command Format

```bash
/plugin-name:command-name [arguments]
```

### Discovering Commands

List all available slash commands from installed plugins:

```bash
/plugin
```

### Benefits of Slash Commands

- **Direct invocation** - No need to describe what you want in natural language
- **Structured arguments** - Pass parameters explicitly for precise control
- **Composability** - Chain commands together for complex workflows
- **Discoverability** - Use `/plugin` to see all available commands

## Natural Language

Agents can also be invoked through natural language when you need Claude to reason about which specialist to use:

```
"Use backend-architect to design the authentication API"
"Have security-auditor scan for OWASP vulnerabilities"
"Get performance-engineer to optimize this database query"
```

Claude Code automatically selects and coordinates the appropriate agents based on your request.

## Multi-Agent Workflow Examples

Plugins provide pre-configured multi-agent workflows accessible via slash commands.

### Full-Stack Development

```bash
# Command-based workflow invocation
/full-stack-orchestration:full-stack-feature "user dashboard with real-time analytics"

# Natural language alternative
"Implement user dashboard with real-time analytics"
```

**Orchestration:** backend-architect → database-architect → frontend-developer → test-automator → security-auditor → deployment-engineer → observability-engineer

**What happens:**

1. Database schema design with migrations
2. Backend API implementation (REST/GraphQL)
3. Frontend components with state management
4. Comprehensive test suite (unit/integration/E2E)
5. Security audit and hardening
6. CI/CD pipeline setup with feature flags
7. Observability and monitoring configuration

### Security Hardening

```bash
# Comprehensive security assessment and remediation
/security-scanning:security-hardening --level comprehensive

# Natural language alternative
"Perform security audit and implement OWASP best practices"
```

**Orchestration:** security-auditor → backend-security-coder → frontend-security-coder → mobile-security-coder → test-automator

### Data/ML Pipeline

```bash
# ML feature development with production deployment
/machine-learning-ops:ml-pipeline "customer churn prediction model"

# Natural language alternative
"Build customer churn prediction model with deployment"
```

**Orchestration:** data-scientist → data-engineer → ml-engineer → mlops-engineer → performance-engineer

### Incident Response

```bash
# Smart debugging with root cause analysis
/incident-response:smart-fix "production memory leak in payment service"

# Natural language alternative
"Debug production memory leak and create runbook"
```

**Orchestration:** incident-responder → devops-troubleshooter → debugger → error-detective → observability-engineer

### C4 Architecture Documentation

```bash
# Generate comprehensive C4 architecture documentation
/c4-architecture:c4-architecture

# Natural language alternative
"Create C4 architecture documentation for this codebase"
```

**Orchestration:** c4-code → c4-component → c4-container → c4-context

**What happens:**

1. **Code Level**: Bottom-up analysis of all subdirectories, creating code-level documentation with function signatures and dependencies
2. **Component Level**: Synthesizes code documentation into logical components with interfaces and relationships
3. **Container Level**: Maps components to deployment containers with OpenAPI/Swagger API specifications
4. **Context Level**: Creates high-level system context with personas, user journeys, and external dependencies

**Output:** Complete C4 documentation in `C4-Documentation/` directory with Mermaid diagrams at all levels (Context, Container, Component, Code)

## Command Arguments and Options

Many slash commands support arguments for precise control:

```bash
# Test generation for specific files
/unit-testing:test-generate src/api/users.py

# Feature development with methodology specification
/backend-development:feature-development OAuth2 integration with social login

# Security dependency scanning
/security-scanning:security-dependencies

# Component scaffolding
/frontend-mobile-development:component-scaffold UserProfile component with hooks

# TDD workflow cycle
/tdd-workflows:tdd-red User can reset password
/tdd-workflows:tdd-green
/tdd-workflows:tdd-refactor

# Smart debugging
/debugging-toolkit:smart-debug memory leak in checkout flow

# Python project scaffolding
/python-development:python-scaffold fastapi-microservice

# C4 architecture documentation generation
/c4-architecture:c4-architecture
```

## Combining Natural Language and Commands

You can mix both approaches for optimal flexibility:

```
# Start with a command for structured workflow
/full-stack-orchestration:full-stack-feature "payment processing"

# Then provide natural language guidance
"Ensure PCI-DSS compliance and integrate with Stripe"
"Add retry logic for failed transactions"
"Set up fraud detection rules"
```

## Best Practices

### When to Use Slash Commands

- **Structured workflows** - Multi-step processes with clear phases
- **Repetitive tasks** - Operations you perform frequently
- **Precise control** - When you need specific parameters
- **Discovery** - Exploring available functionality

### When to Use Natural Language

- **Exploratory work** - When you're not sure which tool to use
- **Complex reasoning** - When Claude needs to coordinate multiple agents
- **Contextual decisions** - When the right approach depends on the situation
- **Ad-hoc tasks** - One-off operations that don't fit a command

### Workflow Composition

Compose multiple plugins for complex scenarios:

```bash
# 1. Start with feature development
/backend-development:feature-development payment processing API

# 2. Add security hardening
/security-scanning:security-hardening

# 3. Generate comprehensive tests
/unit-testing:test-generate

# 4. Review the implementation
/code-review-ai:ai-review

# 5. Set up CI/CD
/cicd-automation:workflow-automate

# 6. Add monitoring
/observability-monitoring:monitor-setup
```

# How Awesome Claude Code Works

This document provides technical details about the repository structure, automated systems, and processes that power Awesome Claude Code.

## Repository Architecture

### Core Files

- **`THE_RESOURCES_TABLE.csv`** - The single source of truth for all resources
- **`README.md`** - Generated automatically from the CSV and templates
- **`templates/`** - Contains templates for README generation
  - `README.template.md` - Main template structure
  - `categories.yaml` - Single source of truth for all categories
  - `resource-overrides.yaml` - Manual overrides for specific resources

### Scripts Directory

The `scripts/` directory contains all automation:

- **`parse_issue_form.py`** - Parses GitHub issue form submissions
- **`create_resource_pr.py`** - Creates PRs from approved submissions
- **`generate_readme.py`** - Generates README from CSV data
- **`validate_single_resource.py`** - Validates individual resources
- **`validate_links.py`** - Bulk validation of all resources
- **`badge_issue_notification.py`** - Creates notification issues on featured repos
- **`quick_id.py`** - Generates unique resource IDs

### GitHub Actions Workflows

Located in `.github/workflows/`:

- **`validate-resource-submission.yml`** - Runs on issue creation/edit
- **`approve-resource-submission.yml`** - Runs on maintainer commands
- **`protect-labels.yml`** - Prevents unauthorized label changes
- **`validate-links.yml`** - Scheduled validation of all resource links
- **Additional workflows for CI/CD and maintenance**

### GitHub Labels

The submission system uses several labels to track issue state:

#### Resource Submission Labels

- **`resource-submission`** - Applied automatically to issues created via the submission form
- **`validation-passed`** - Applied when submission passes all validation checks
- **`validation-failed`** - Applied when submission fails validation
- **`approved`** - Applied when maintainer approves submission with `/approve`
- **`pr-created`** - Applied after PR is successfully created
- **`error-creating-pr`** - Applied if PR creation fails
- **`rejected`** - Applied when maintainer rejects with `/reject`
- **`changes-requested`** - Applied when maintainer requests changes with `/request-changes`

#### Other Labels

- **`broken-links`** - Applied by scheduled link validation when resources become unavailable
- **`automated`** - Applied alongside `broken-links` to indicate automated detection

#### Label Protection

All submission-related labels are protected from unauthorized changes. The `protect-labels.yml` workflow automatically reverts any label changes made by non-maintainers (users without OWNER, MEMBER, or COLLABORATOR permissions).

#### Label State Transitions

1. New submission → `resource-submission`
2. After validation → adds `validation-passed` OR `validation-failed`
3. If changes requested → adds `changes-requested`
4. When user edits and validation passes → removes `changes-requested`
5. On approval → adds `approved` + `pr-created` (or `error-creating-pr`)
6. On rejection → adds `rejected`

## The Submission Flow

### 1. User Submits Issue

When a user submits a resource via the issue form:

```yaml
# .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/submit-resource.yml
- Structured form with all required fields
- Auto-labels with "resource-submission"
- Validates input formats
```

### 2. Automated Validation

The validation workflow triggers immediately:

```python
# Simplified validation flow
1. Parse issue body → extract form data
2. Validate required fields
3. Check URL accessibility
4. Verify no duplicates exist
5. Post results as comment
6. Update issue labels
```

**Validation includes:**

- URL validation (200 OK response)
- License detection from GitHub API
- Duplicate checking against existing CSV
- Field format validation

### 3. Maintainer Review

Once validation passes, maintainers can:

- `/approve` - Triggers PR creation
- `/request-changes [reason]` - Asks for modifications
- `/reject [reason]` - Closes the submission

**Notification System:**

- When changes are requested, the maintainer is @-mentioned in the comment
- When the user edits their issue, the maintainer receives a notification if:
  - It's the first edit after requesting changes
  - The validation status changes (pass→fail or fail→pass)
- Multiple rapid edits won't spam the maintainer with notifications

### 4. Automated PR Creation

Upon approval:

```bash
1. Checkout fresh main branch
2. Create unique branch: add-resource/category/name-timestamp
3. Add resource to CSV with generated ID
4. Run generate_readme.py
5. Commit changes
6. Push branch
7. Create PR via GitHub CLI
8. Link back to original issue
9. Close submission issue
```

### 5. Final Steps

- Maintainer merges PR
- Badge notification system runs (if enabled)
- Submitter receives GitHub notifications

## Resource ID Generation

IDs follow the format: `{prefix}-{hash}`

```python
prefixes = {
    "Agent Skills": "skill",
    "Slash-Commands": "cmd",
    "Workflows & Knowledge Guides": "wf",
    "Tooling": "tool",
    "CLAUDE.md Files": "claude",
    "Hooks": "hook",
    "Official Documentation": "doc",
}

# Hash is first 8 chars of SHA256(display_name + primary_link)
```

## CSV Structure

| Field          | Description          | Required    | Auto-populated       |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ----------- | -------------------- |
| ID             | Unique identifier    | Yes         | Yes                  |
| Display Name   | Resource name        | Yes         | No                   |
| Category       | Main category        | Yes         | No                   |
| Sub-Category   | Optional subcategory | No          | No                   |
| Primary Link   | Main URL             | Yes         | No                   |
| Secondary Link | Additional URL       | No          | No                   |
| Author Name    | Creator name         | Yes         | No                   |
| Author Link    | Creator profile      | Yes         | No                   |
| Active         | TRUE/FALSE status    | Yes         | Yes (via validation) |
| Date Added     | Addition date        | No          | Yes                  |
| Last Modified  | GitHub last commit   | No          | Yes (from API)       |
| Last Checked   | Validation timestamp | Yes         | Yes                  |
| License        | SPDX identifier      | Recommended | Yes (from GitHub)    |
| Description    | Brief description    | Yes         | No                   |

## README Generation

The README is generated from templates using:

```yaml
# templates/categories.yaml
categories:
  - id: workflows
    name: "Workflows & Knowledge Guides"
    prefix: wf
    icon: "🧠"
    order: 1
    
  - id: statusline
    name: "Status Lines"
    prefix: status
    icon: "📊"
    order: 3
```

Generation process:

1. Load CSV data
2. Apply any overrides from `resource-overrides.yaml`
3. Group by category/subcategory
4. Format using templates
5. Write final README

### Collapsible Sections

The generated README uses HTML `<details>` elements for improved navigation:

- **Categories without subcategories**: Wrapped in `<details open>` (fully collapsible)
- **Categories with subcategories**: Regular headers (subcategories are collapsible)
- **All subcategories**: Wrapped in `<details open>` elements
- **Table of Contents**: Collapsible with nested sections for categories with subcategories
- All collapsible sections are open by default for easy browsing

**Design Note**: Initially attempted to make all categories collapsible with nested subcategories, but this caused anchor link navigation issues - links from the Table of Contents couldn't reach subcategories when their parent category was collapsed. The current design balances navigation functionality with collapsibility.

### GitHub Stats Integration

Each GitHub resource in the README automatically includes a collapsible statistics section:

- **Automatic Detection**: The `parse_github_url` function from `validate_links.py` identifies GitHub repositories
- **Stats Display**: Uses the GitHub Stats API to generate an SVG badge with repository metrics
- **Collapsible Design**: Stats are hidden by default in a `<details>` element to keep the main list clean
- **Universal Support**: Works with all GitHub URL formats (repository root, blob URLs, tree URLs, etc.)
- **API Endpoint**: `https://github-readme-stats-plus-theta.vercel.app/api/pin/?repo=REPO&username=USER&all_stats=true&stats_only=true`

Example output for a GitHub resource:

```markdown
[`resource-name`](https://github.com/owner/repo)
Description of the resource

<details>
<summary>📊 GitHub Stats</summary>
<br>

![GitHub Stats for repo](https://github-readme-stats-plus-theta.vercel.app/api/pin/?repo=repo&username=owner&all_stats=true&stats_only=true)

</details>
```

### Announcements System

Announcements are stored in `templates/announcements.yaml`:

- YAML format for structured data
- Renders as nested collapsible sections
- Each date group is collapsible
- Individual items can be simple text or collapsible with summary/text
- Falls back to `.md` file if YAML doesn't exist

## Validation System

### Link Validation

- Checks HTTP status (200-299 = valid)
- Handles redirects
- Respects rate limits
- Caches results for efficiency

### GitHub-Specific Features

For GitHub links:

- Fetches repository metadata
- Extracts license information
- Gets last commit date
- Checks if repository exists/is public

### Override System

The `templates/resource-overrides.yaml` allows:

- Locking specific fields from updates
- Skipping validation for special cases
- Manual corrections to auto-detected data

## Security Considerations

1. **Input Validation** - All user input is sanitized
2. **URL Validation** - Only HTTPS URLs accepted
3. **GitHub Token Scoping** - Minimal permissions required
4. **Review Process** - Human review before code changes
5. **Automated Checks** - No direct CSV manipulation by users

## Environment Variables

- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - For API access (provided by Actions)
- `AWESOME_CC_PAT_PUBLIC_REPO` - For creating notification issues
- `CREATE_ISSUES` - Enable/disable notification system

## Local Development

To test locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Test validation
python scripts/validate_single_resource.py "https://example.com"

# Generate README
python scripts/generate_readme.py

# Parse a test issue
ISSUE_BODY="..." python scripts/parse_issue_form.py --validate
```

## Adding New Categories

Repository maintainers can add new categories using the automated tool:

### Interactive Mode

```bash
make add-category
```

This will prompt you for:

- Category name
- ID and prefix
- Icon emoji
- Description
- Order position
- Subcategories

### Command Line Mode

```bash
make add-category ARGS='--name "My Category" --prefix "mycat" --icon "🎯"'
```

### What It Does

The `add-category` command automatically:

1. Updates `templates/categories.yaml` with the new category
2. Updates the GitHub issue template dropdown
3. Regenerates the README with the new section
4. Optionally creates a commit with all changes

### Examples

```bash
# Add a simple category with defaults
make add-category ARGS='--name "Extensions" --prefix "ext" --icon "🧩"'

# Add a category with multiple subcategories
make add-category ARGS='--name "Integrations" --prefix "int" --icon "🔗" --subcategories "API,Webhooks,Plugins"'

# Add a category at a specific position
make add-category ARGS='--name "Templates" --prefix "tmpl" --icon "📋" --order 5'
```

## Maintenance Tasks

### Regular Tasks

- Monitor validation failures
- Update templates as needed
- Review and merge PRs
- Handle edge cases with overrides

### Bulk Operations

```bash
# Validate all links
make validate

# Sort resources
make sort

# Regenerate README
make generate
```

## Contributing to the System

To improve the automation:

1. Test changes locally first
2. Update relevant documentation
3. Consider backward compatibility
4. Add tests if applicable
5. Submit PR with clear description

## 🎯 Agent Philosophy

### 🧠 **Guidance-First Approach**

Our agents function as **specialized architectural consultants** rather than code generators. They help you:

- **Make Technology Decisions**: When to use React vs Vue, PostgreSQL vs MongoDB
- **Choose Architecture Patterns**: Microservices vs monolith, CQRS vs traditional CRUD
- **Optimize Performance**: Caching strategies, database tuning, scaling approaches
- **Navigate Ecosystems**: Library selection, version management, best practices
- **Solve Design Problems**: Code organization, testing strategies, deployment patterns

### 📏 **Agent Design Principles**

- **Decision Frameworks**: Clear when/why/how guidance for technology choices
- **Architectural Focus**: System design and structural decisions over syntax
- **Production-Ready**: Enterprise-grade patterns and real-world considerations
- **Ecosystem Navigation**: Modern tooling and library selection guidance
- **Best Practices**: Security, performance, and maintainability built-in

## ✨ What Makes These Agents Different

### 🎯 **Decision-Focused Architecture**

Unlike traditional code-generation agents, our agents are designed as **specialized consultants** that help you make informed architectural and technology decisions:

```
Traditional Agents:          Our Agents:
"Here's React code"    →     "When to choose React vs Vue vs Angular"
"FastAPI example"      →     "Django vs FastAPI vs Flask decision matrix"  
"Docker config"        →     "Containerization strategy and patterns"
"AWS Lambda code"      →     "Serverless vs container deployment decisions"
```

### 📊 **Research-Based Design**

Based on analysis of successful Claude Code agent repositories, our agents follow proven patterns:

- **300-800 lines**: Focused, actionable content (vs 2000+ line tutorials)
- **80/20 Guidance/Code**: Decision frameworks over implementations
- **Production-Ready**: Enterprise patterns and real-world considerations  
- **Model-Optimized**: Sonnet for complex decisions, Haiku for simple tasks

### 🏗️ **Architectural Consultant Approach**

Each agent acts as a domain expert consultant providing:

- **Technology Selection**: When/why to choose specific tools and frameworks
- **Architecture Patterns**: System design and structural decisions
- **Performance Optimization**: Scaling strategies and bottleneck identification  
- **Best Practices**: Security, maintainability, and operational excellence

# Awesome MCP Servers ![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)

A curated list of awesome Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. MCP is an open protocol that enables AI models to securely interact with local and remote resources through standardized server implementations. This list focuses on production-ready and experimental MCP servers that extend AI capabilities through file access, database connections, API integrations, and other contextual services.

<br />

## ⚠️ Security Warning

> [!WARNING]
> When running MCP servers without proper sandboxing, they can execute arbitrary code on your system with the same permissions as the host process. This creates significant security risks.
>
> **Security Risks:**
>
> - **System Access**: Full access to files, network, and system resources
> - **Code Execution**: Can run any command on your machine
> - **Prompt Injection**: Malicious prompts could trigger unintended server actions
> - **Data Exposure**: Sensitive data may be accessed or leaked
>
> **Best Practices:**
>
> - Use official implementations (marked with ⭐) when available
> - Run servers in VMs or isolated environments
> - Review code before installation
> - Limit permissions to minimum required
> - Monitor server activity
