# Brainstorming to Implementation

Collaborative workflow for transforming vague ideas into well-defined features through structured dialogue before specification.

For well-defined requirements, skip brainstorming and use [Spec-Driven Development](./spec-driven-development.md) directly.

## When to Use

- Unclear or incomplete requirements that need refinement
- Exploring multiple approaches before committing to a direction
- New features where you know the goal but not the implementation
- Stakeholder alignment needed before detailed planning

## Plugins needed for this workflow

- [SDD](../plugins/sdd/README.md)
- [Code Review](../plugins/code-review/README.md)
- [Git](../plugins/git/README.md)

```

### 1. Brainstorm the idea

Use the `/sdd:brainstorm` command to start a collaborative dialogue. The LLM will explore your project context and ask clarifying questions one at a time.

```bash
/sdd:brainstorm Users want better search but requirements are unclear
```

After starting, the LLM will:
- Review your project structure, docs, and recent commits
- Ask focused questions (preferring multiple choice when possible)
- Help you define purpose, constraints, and success criteria

Answer each question to progressively refine the idea. The conversation continues until requirements are clear.

### 2. Explore approaches

Once the LLM understands your needs, it will propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs.

```md
The LLM will present options like:

**Option A: Elasticsearch Integration** (Recommended)
- Full-text search with faceting
- Trade-off: Additional infrastructure

**Option B: PostgreSQL Full-Text Search**
- No new dependencies
- Trade-off: Limited faceting capabilities

**Option C: Algolia Service**
- Fastest implementation
- Trade-off: External dependency and cost
```

After reviewing options, select your preferred approach or ask for more exploration. The LLM leads with its recommendation and explains the reasoning.

### 3. Present design

The LLM presents the validated approach as a design document in 200-300 word sections, checking after each section whether it looks right.

```md
The LLM will cover:
- Architecture overview
- Component breakdown
- Data flow
- Error handling
- Testing approach
```

After each section, confirm it matches your expectations or request changes. Once complete, the design is saved to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`.

### 4. Create specification

Use the `/sdd:01-specify` command to create a formal specification from the refined design.

```bash
/sdd:01-specify Implement faceted search with Elasticsearch, filters, and autocomplete
```

After LLM completes, review the specification in the `specs/` directory. This becomes the foundation for implementation planning.

### 5. Plan architecture

Use the `/sdd:02-plan` command to create the implementation plan based on your specification.

```bash
/sdd:02-plan
```

After LLM completes, review the proposed architecture and technical decisions.

### 6. Break down into tasks

Use the `/sdd:03-tasks` command to create actionable implementation tasks.

```bash
/sdd:03-tasks
```

After LLM completes, review the task list and adjust priorities as needed.

### 7. Implement features

Use the `/sdd:04-implement` command to execute the implementation.

```bash
/sdd:04-implement
```

During implementation, the LLM updates task progress and follows TDD approach with quality review.

### 8. Review and document

Complete the workflow with code review, documentation, and pull request creation. More info in [Spec-Driven Development](./spec-driven-development.md) workflow.

```bash
/code-review:review-local-changes
/sdd:05-document
/git:create-pr
```

After completion, your feature is ready for merge with full documentation in the `docs/` directory.

## Key Principles

The brainstorming phase follows these principles to ensure productive refinement:

- **One question at a time** - Focused dialogue prevents overwhelm
- **Multiple choice preferred** - Easier to answer than open-ended questions
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features from designs
- **Explore alternatives** - Always consider 2-3 approaches before committing
- **Incremental validation** - Present design in sections, validate each one
