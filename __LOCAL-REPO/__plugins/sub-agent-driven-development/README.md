# SADD Plugin (Subagent-Driven Development)

Execution framework that dispatches fresh subagents for each task with quality gates between iterations, enabling fast parallel development while maintaining code quality.

Focused on:

- **Fresh context per task** - Each subagent starts clean without context pollution from previous tasks
- **Quality gates** - Code review between tasks catches issues early before they compound
- **Parallel execution** - Independent tasks run concurrently for faster completion
- **Sequential execution** - Dependent tasks execute in order with review checkpoints

## Plugin Target

- Prevent context pollution - Fresh subagents avoid accumulated confusion from long sessions
- Catch issues early - Code review between tasks prevents bugs from compounding
- Faster iteration - Parallel execution of independent tasks saves time
- Maintain quality at scale - Quality gates ensure standards are met on every task

## Overview

The SADD plugin provides a skill for executing implementation plans through coordinated subagents. Instead of executing all tasks in a single long session where context accumulates and quality degrades, SADD dispatches a fresh subagent for each task with mandatory code review between tasks.

This approach solves the "context pollution" problem - when an agent accumulates confusion, outdated assumptions, or implementation drift over long sessions. Each fresh subagent reads the plan, implements its specific task, and reports back. A code reviewer then validates the work before proceeding.

The plugin supports both sequential execution (for dependent tasks) and parallel execution (for independent tasks), with built-in quality gates that ensure code review happens at appropriate checkpoints.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install the plugin
/plugin install sadd@NeoLabHQ/context-engineering-kit

# Use the skill when you have an implementation plan
> I have a plan in specs/feature/plan.md with 5 tasks. Please use subagent-driven development to implement it.

# Or when facing multiple independent issues
> We have 4 failing test files in different areas. Use subagent-driven development to fix them in parallel.
```

## Skills Overview

### subagent-driven-development - Task Execution with Quality Gates

Use when executing implementation plans with independent tasks or facing multiple independent issues that can be investigated without shared state - dispatches fresh subagent for each task with code review between tasks.

- Purpose - Execute plans through coordinated subagents with quality checkpoints
- Output - Completed implementation with all tasks verified and reviewed

#### When to Use SADD

**Use SADD when:**

- You have an implementation plan with 3+ distinct tasks
- Tasks can be executed independently (or in clear sequence)
- You need quality gates between implementation steps
- Context would accumulate over a long implementation session
- Multiple unrelated failures need parallel investigation
- Different subsystems need changes that do not conflict

**Use regular development when:**

- Single task or simple change
- Tasks are tightly coupled and need shared understanding
- Exploratory work where scope is undefined
- You need human-in-the-loop feedback between every step

## How It Works

SADD supports three execution modes based on task relationships:

**Sequential Execution**

For dependent tasks that must be executed in order:

```
Plan Load → Task 1 → Review → Task 2 → Review → Task 3 → ... → Final Review → Complete
            ↓        ↓        ↓        ↓        ↓
         Subagent  Quality  Subagent  Quality  Subagent
                    Gate              Gate
```

**Parallel Execution**

For independent tasks that can run concurrently:

```
                  ┌─ Task 1 (Subagent) ─┐
Plan Load → Batch ┼─ Task 2 (Subagent) ─┼─ Batch Review → Next Batch → Final Review → Complete
                  └─ Task 3 (Subagent) ─┘
```

**Parallel Investigation**

Special case for fixing multiple unrelated failures:

```
                        ┌─ Domain 1 (Agent) ─┐
Identify Domains → Fix ─┼─ Domain 2 (Agent) ─┼─ Review & Integrate → Complete
                        └─ Domain 3 (Agent) ─┘
```

### Multi-Agent Analysis Orchestration

Command often orchestrate multiple agents to provide comprehensive analysis:

**Sequential Analysis:**

```
Command → Agent 1 → Agent 2 → Agent 3 → Synthesized Result
```

**Parallel Analysis:**

```
         ┌─ Agent 1 ─┐
Command ─┼─ Agent 2 ─┼─ Synthesized Result
         └─ Agent 3 ─┘
```

**Debate Pattern:**

```
Command → Agent 1 ─┐
       → Agent 2 ─┼─ Debate → Consensus → Result
       → Agent 3 ─┘
```

## Processes

### Sequential Execution Process

1. **Load Plan**: Read plan file and create TodoWrite with all tasks

2. **Execute Task with Subagent**: For each task, dispatch a fresh subagent:
   - Subagent reads the specific task from the plan
   - Implements exactly what the task specifies
   - Writes tests following project conventions
   - Verifies implementation works
   - Commits the work
   - Reports back with summary

3. **Review Subagent's Work**: Dispatch a code-reviewer subagent:
   - Reviews what was implemented against the plan
   - Returns: Strengths, Issues (Critical/Important/Minor), Assessment
   - Quality gate: Must pass before proceeding

4. **Apply Review Feedback**:
   - Fix Critical issues immediately (dispatch fix subagent)
   - Fix Important issues before next task
   - Note Minor issues for later

5. **Mark Complete, Next Task**: Update TodoWrite and proceed to next task

6. **Final Review**: After all tasks, dispatch final reviewer for overall assessment

7. **Complete Development**: Use finishing-a-development-branch skill to verify and close

### Parallel Execution Process

1. **Load and Review Plan**: Read plan, identify concerns, create TodoWrite

2. **Execute Batch**: Execute first 3 tasks (default batch size):
   - Mark each as in_progress
   - Follow each step exactly
   - Run verifications as specified
   - Mark as completed

3. **Report**: Show what was implemented and verification output

4. **Continue**: Apply feedback if needed, execute next batch

5. **Complete Development**: Final verification and close

### Parallel Investigation Process

For multiple unrelated failures (different files, subsystems, bugs):

1. **Identify Independent Domains**: Group failures by what is broken
2. **Create Focused Agent Tasks**: Each agent gets specific scope, clear goal, constraints
3. **Dispatch in Parallel**: All agents run concurrently
4. **Review and Integrate**: Verify fixes do not conflict, run full suite

#### Quality Gates

Quality gates are enforced at key checkpoints:

| Checkpoint | Gate Type | Action on Failure |
|------------|-----------|-------------------|
| After each task (sequential) | Code review | Fix issues before next task |
| After batch (parallel) | Human review | Apply feedback, continue |
| Final review | Comprehensive review | Address all findings |
| Before merge | Full test suite | All tests must pass |

**Issue Severity Handling:**

- **Critical**: Fix immediately, do not proceed until resolved
- **Important**: Fix before next task or batch
- **Minor**: Note for later, do not block progress
