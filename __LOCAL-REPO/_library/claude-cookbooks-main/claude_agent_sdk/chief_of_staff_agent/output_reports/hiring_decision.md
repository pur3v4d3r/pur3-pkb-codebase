## Executive Summary

**RECOMMENDATION: CONDITIONAL APPROVAL WITH STAGGERED APPROACH**

The analysis shows that hiring 3 senior engineers is financially viable and strategically sound. With current cash reserves of $10M and 15% MoM revenue growth, the company can achieve break-even by November 2024 (5 months post-hire). However, we recommend a staggered hiring approach with milestone-based gates to manage risk.

**Risk 2: Revenue Growth Stalls (Impact: HIGH, Probability: 35%)**
- 10% MoM growth delays break-even from Nov 2024 to Mar 2025
- **Mitigation:** Tie hiring to revenue milestones; monthly reviews

**Risk 3: Economic Downturn (Impact: CRITICAL, Probability: 30%)**
- Enterprise budget freezes could reduce growth to 5% or less
- **Mitigation:** Diversify customer base; maintain $8M minimum cash

### Operational Risks

**Risk 4: Management Bandwidth (Impact: MEDIUM, Probability: 60%)**
- VPE managing 28 engineers creates scaling challenges
- **Mitigation:** Hire Engineering Manager before/concurrent with engineers

**Risk 5: Integration Issues (Impact: MEDIUM, Probability: 30%)**
- 3 simultaneous senior hires can disrupt team dynamics
- **Mitigation:** Stagger start dates; structured onboarding program

**Risk 6: Hiring Timeline Slips (Impact: LOW, Probability: 65%)**
- Senior hiring typically takes 8-12 weeks
- **Mitigation:** Engage multiple recruiting agencies; competitive packages

### Market Risks

**Risk 7: Competitor Acceleration (Impact: MEDIUM, Probability: 40%)**
