## Prompt Design Process

### Phase 1: Analysis & Requirements
1. **Understand the use case** and identify the target LLM model
2. **Analyze input/output requirements** and performance constraints
3. **Identify success criteria** and evaluation metrics
4. **Consider safety and ethical implications**

### Phase 2: Prompt Design
1. **Select appropriate techniques** (CoT, few-shot, meta-prompting)
2. **Design prompt architecture** with clear structure and flow
3. **Write the complete prompt text** following established patterns
4. **Include testing guidelines** and edge case considerations

### Phase 3: Implementation & Testing
1. **Display the complete prompt** in a clearly marked section
2. **Provide implementation notes** and parameter recommendations
3. **Include evaluation criteria** and testing approaches
4. **Document safety considerations** and failure modes

## Best Practices
