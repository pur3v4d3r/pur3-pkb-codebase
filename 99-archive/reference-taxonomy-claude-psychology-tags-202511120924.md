> [!the-purpose]
> **This note provides a complete, hierarchical Tag Taxonomy for the Cognitive Abilities & Self-Improvement domain of your PKB.** It includes the full tag structure, semantic definitions, usage guidelines, practical examples, and integration strategies with your broader tagging system. This is your authoritative reference for consistently tagging notes in this domain.

> [!core-principle]
> **Design Philosophy:** This taxonomy balances **theoretical rigor** with **practical application**. It's structured to support both academic research (theories, models, empirical findings) and personal development practice (techniques, reflections, skill-building). The hierarchy enables both broad filtering (all cognitive science) and granular querying (specific techniques within metacognition).

---

## 📚 Taxonomy Overview

This taxonomy organizes the **Cognitive Abilities & Self-Improvement** domain into a three-level hierarchical structure:

```
#domain/subdomain/concept
```

**Depth rationale:** Three levels provide enough granularity for precise filtering without becoming unwieldy. The structure mirrors the conceptual organization of the field itself, making it intuitive and memorable.

## 📋 Practical Tag Combinations: Examples

> [!use-cases-and-examples]
> **Real-World Tagging Scenarios:**

### Example 1: Literature Note on Self-Determination Theory

```yaml
---
tags:
  - type/literature
  - self-regulation/theory/self-determination
  - self-regulation/motivation/intrinsic
  - source/book
  - status/evergreen
  - context/theoretical
aliases:
  - SDT
  - Deci and Ryan Theory
author: Edward Deci & Richard Ryan
---
```

**Rationale:** This is a well-developed literature note from a book about a theoretical framework. It addresses intrinsic motivation within the broader self-regulation domain.

---

### Example 2: Permanent Note on Applying Metacognitive Monitoring

```yaml
---
tags:
  - type/permanent
  - cognitive-science/metacognition/monitoring
  - self-improvement/reflective-practice
  - concept/retrieval-practice
  - status/evergreen
  - context/applied
  - mode/synthetic
aliases:
  - Monitoring My Understanding
  - Metacognitive Awareness Practice
---
```

**Rationale:** This is original synthesis connecting metacognitive theory to practical reflective techniques. It spans both theoretical understanding and personal application.

---

### Example 3: Technique Note on Pomodoro for Cognitive Load

```yaml
---
tags:
  - type/technique
  - cognitive-science/cognitive-load/management
  - cognitive-science/attention/sustained
  - self-improvement/productivity/focus-techniques
  - status/budding
  - context/personal
  - mode/practical
aliases:
  - Pomodoro Technique
  - Time Boxing for Focus
---
```

**Rationale:** This is a specific technique note that bridges cognitive theory (attention, cognitive load) with practical productivity application. Still developing (budding status).

---

### Example 4: Practice Log on Critical Thinking Exercise

```yaml
---
tags:
  - type/practice-log
  - critical-thinking/analysis/argument-analysis
  - self-improvement/skill-development/deliberate-practice
  - context/personal
  - mode/reflective
date: 2025-11-12
status: complete
---
```

**Rationale:** This is a personal log documenting deliberate practice of critical thinking skills. The date property is crucial for practice logs.

---

### Example 5: MOC for Cognitive Load Theory

```yaml
---
tags:
  - type/moc
  - cognitive-science/cognitive-load
  - context/theoretical
  - status/evergreen
aliases:
  - CLT Hub
  - Cognitive Load Map
---
```

**Rationale:** A Map of Content serving as a navigation hub for all cognitive load-related notes. MOCs typically have fewer domain tags since they aggregate content rather than represent it.

---

### Example 6: Synthesis Note on Motivation and Metacognition

```yaml
---
tags:
  - type/synthesis
  - cognitive-science/metacognition
  - self-regulation/motivation
  - self-regulation/theory/self-determination
  - status/budding
  - context/theoretical
  - mode/synthetic
aliases:
  - Motivation-Metacognition Connection
  - Why Motivation Affects Self-Awareness
---
```

**Rationale:** A synthesis note exploring the intersection of two domain areas. Captures emergent insights from connecting different bodies of literature.

## 🎓 Tag Usage Guidelines

> [!core-principle]
> **Consistency Protocol:** Follow these rules to maintain taxonomy integrity:

### Rule 1: Minimum Tag Requirement
Every note in this domain MUST have:
- **One Type tag** (e.g., `#type/permanent`)
- **One Status tag** (e.g., `#status/evergreen`)
- **One or more Domain tags** (e.g., `#cognitive-science/metacognition`)

### Rule 2: Maximum Tag Density
- **Target:** 4-7 tags per note
- **Ceiling:** Never exceed 10 tags on a single note
- If you're hitting 10+, you're likely over-tagging or the note lacks focus

### Rule 3: Hierarchical Consistency
- Always use the **most specific** tag that applies
- If you tag `#cognitive-science/metacognition/monitoring`, you do NOT also need `#cognitive-science/metacognition` or `#cognitive-science` (Obsidian's search includes parent tags automatically)

### Rule 4: Cross-Cutting Concepts
- Use `#concept/` tags to capture specific cognitive phenomena that appear across domains
- A note can have multiple concept tags if it addresses multiple phenomena

### Rule 5: Context and Mode Tags
- `#context/` tags are OPTIONAL—use when the application context is significant
- `#mode/` tags are OPTIONAL—use for filtering by cognitive approach

### Rule 6: Source Attribution
- ALWAYS include a `#source/` tag for literature notes
- Consider adding author and date properties to frontmatter for literature notes

## 🔄 Tag Maintenance Schedule

> [!methodology-and-sources]
> **Quarterly Tag Audit Process:**

### Every 3 Months (Quarterly Review):

**Step 1: Tag Frequency Analysis**
Run this query to identify your most-used tags:

```dataviewjs
let tagCount = {}
for (let page of dv.pages('#cognitive-science OR #critical-thinking OR #self-regulation OR #learning-theory OR #self-improvement')) {
    for (let tag of page.file.tags) {
        tagCount[tag] = (tagCount[tag] || 0) + 1
    }
}
let sorted = Object.entries(tagCount).sort((a,b) => b[1] - a[1])
dv.table(["Tag", "Usage Count"], sorted.slice(0, 30))
```

**Step 2: Identify Orphaned Tags**
Find tags used only once or twice:

```dataviewjs
let tagCount = {}
for (let page of dv.pages('#cognitive-science OR #critical-thinking OR #self-regulation OR #learning-theory OR #self-improvement')) {
    for (let tag of page.file.tags) {
        tagCount[tag] = (tagCount[tag] || 0) + 1
    }
}
let orphaned = Object.entries(tagCount)
    .filter(([tag, count]) => count <= 2)
    .sort((a,b) => a[1] - b[1])
dv.table(["Orphaned Tag", "Count"], orphaned)
```

**Step 3: Consolidation Decision**
For each orphaned tag, decide:
- Merge with existing tag (use Tag Wrangler plugin)
- Keep if it represents an emerging area of study
- Delete if it was a tagging error

**Step 4: Consistency Check**
Search for common inconsistencies:
- Plural vs. singular (standardize to singular)
- Hyphenation variations
- Capitalization errors
- Synonyms that should be merged

## ⚠️ Common Tagging Mistakes in This Domain

> [!warning]
> **Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**

### ❌ Mistake 1: Over-Specificity in Type Tags
**Bad:**
```yaml
tags:
  - type/literature/book/chapter
```

**Good:**
```yaml
tags:
  - type/literature
source: book
```

**Why:** Use properties for specific metadata, not nested type tags.

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: Redundant Hierarchy
**Bad:**
```yaml
tags:
  - cognitive-science
  - cognitive-science/metacognition
  - cognitive-science/metacognition/monitoring
```

**Good:**
```yaml
tags:
  - cognitive-science/metacognition/monitoring
```

**Why:** Obsidian's search automatically includes parent tags. Only tag the most specific level.

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: Confusing Tags with Links
**Bad:**
```yaml
tags:
  - self-determination-theory
  - cognitive-load-theory
  - growth-mindset-theory
```

**Good:**
```yaml
tags:
  - self-regulation/theory/self-determination
  
Related theories:

- [[Growth Mindset]]
```

**Why:** Specific theories should be separate notes with links, not tags. Tags describe categories, links describe relationships.

### ❌ Mistake 4: Context Overload
**Bad:**
```yaml
tags:
  - context/personal
  - context/professional
  - context/academic
  - context/teaching
```

**Good:**
```yaml
tags:
  - context/professional
```

**Why:** Choose the PRIMARY context, not all possible contexts.

---

### ❌ Mistake 5: Using Tags for Properties
**Bad:**
```yaml
tags:
  - author/daniel-kahneman
  - year/2011
  - pages/499
```

**Good:**
```yaml
tags:
  - type/literature
  - cognitive-science/reasoning
author: Daniel Kahneman
year: 2011
pages: 499
```

**Why:** Specific, unique metadata belongs in YAML properties, not tags.

## 🚀 Getting Started: Implementation Checklist

> [!tasks]
> **Follow this checklist to implement your new taxonomy:**

- [ ] **Create MOC Note:** Use the template above to create your `[[Cognitive Abilities & Self-Improvement MOC]]`
- [ ] **Document This Taxonomy:** Save this note as `[[Tag Taxonomy - Cognitive Abilities]]` in your PKB reference section
- [ ] **Audit Existing Notes:** Run Dataview query to find all notes in this domain currently without proper tags
- [ ] **Retag Top 20 Notes:** Start with your most valuable notes and retag them using the new taxonomy
- [ ] **Set Up Templates:** Create note templates with pre-filled tag structures for each note type
- [ ] **Create Dashboard:** Build a domain dashboard using the Dataview queries provided
- [ ] **Schedule First Review:** Add quarterly tag audit to your calendar
- [ ] **Link from Main PKB Index:** Ensure your main PKB index links to your new Cognitive Abilities MOC

<thinking>
The user is asking me to create a comprehensive Tag Taxonomy specifically for their PKB, focused on a particular domain: Cognitive Abilities/Self-Improvement. They've given me specific examples of the types of materials they're studying:
- Metacognition
- Self-Regulation Theory
- Self-Determination Theory
- Critical Thinking
- Cognitive Load Management
- Andragogy

This is a request for a practical, actionable taxonomy document that they can implement in their Obsidian vault. I need to:

1. Research and understand the full scope of this domain
2. Create a hierarchical tag structure that covers their specific topics plus related areas
3. Provide clear definitions and usage guidelines
4. Include practical examples
5. Show how this integrates with multi-dimensional tagging (type, status, source, etc.)
6. Provide Dataview queries and MOC structures they can use
7. Make it immediately usable in their vault

This should be a Reference Note type document with comprehensive metadata.

Key considerations:
- The domain spans psychology, education, philosophy (critical thinking), and cognitive science
- Need to balance depth with usability
- Should integrate with their existing PKB structure
- Must include both theory and practice/application
- Should accommodate both academic research and practical self-improvement content

Structure for the taxonomy:
1. Core domain tags (the main hierarchical structure)
2. Cross-cutting concept tags
3. Practice/application tags
4. Integration with functional tags (type, status, source)
5. Example tag combinations
6. Dataview queries for this domain
7. MOC template for cognitive abilities domain
