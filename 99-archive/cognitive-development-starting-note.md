Stoic framework-Dichotomy of Control
By integrating classical philosophical wisdom with contemporary neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and clinical research, this article reveals the Dichotomy of Control not merely as an abstract philosophical principle but as a concrete, trainable cognitive skill with profound implications for mental health, performance optimization, and human flourishing. The findings suggest that explicit training in this Stoic framework represents a powerful intervention for enhancing adaptive self-regulation across clinical, educational, and organizational contexts.[[2025-11-07]]
