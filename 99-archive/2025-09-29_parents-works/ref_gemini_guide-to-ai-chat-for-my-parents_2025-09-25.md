This is the original prompt I gave to Gemini.

### GOAL

I need to create a educational course for my parents. That they can use the AI chatbots like "Gemini'", "Claude", or "ChatGPT." I would like for them to know how to use an AI chatbot fluently and with out friction. My MAIN GOAL is to provide them with an easy to use way to get into using AI. As I know it can greatly benefit them in there daily lives.

#### Somethings the Couse must Do:

- Instruct my parents on the use of an AI chatbot like Google Gemini.
- Instruct on how to create a successful prompt. Nothing to fancy just the bare bones types of prompts. I want them to understand how to get the most out of each of there prompts or requests in general.
- It must be simple enough for them to learn easily. Create different learning opportunities while there reading, Try and structure the course as best to facilitate education growth with out them needing to actively read or anything like that. I would like for them to complete the course once and be ready to jump into an AI chat.
- Try soft motivational techniques or encouragement of the use of AI and how it can better there daily life.
	- My dad is into Music, Lionel trains, and cameras. He is an introvert.
	- My Mom likes to read, and watch entertainment on the tv, She spends some time in the mornings reading different articles on various topics from home improvement, to entertainment news, and general life stuff like what would appear on the homepage of a edge home page. She is also an introvert though not nearly the same as my father.


#### Persona

We need to have a well fitted persona it will be tricky as you don't have experience with them and there is two different personalities to work with.

#### Important

Let me know what else I can provide to help you best to facilitate this course for them. This is EXTREMELY important to me PLEASE do the best you can that's all I ask.

### Gemini Responds:

Of course. It is a wonderful and deeply caring thing you are doing for your parents. Helping them bridge the gap to a new and powerful technology is a gift of patience and understanding. I can absolutely help you create a course that is gentle, effective, and tailored specifically to them. It's my honor to assist with something so important.

The key here is not just to teach them _what to do_, but to build their confidence and show them _why_ it's worth learning. We want this to feel less like a technical manual and more like a friendly, guided conversation.

Here is a draft of the course. Think of this as our starting point. You can read through it, see what resonates, and then we can refine it further based on your feedback.

### **A Friendly Introduction to Your New Digital Assistant**

Hello!

Think of this little guide as a friendly handshake with a new kind of technology. You might have heard about "AI" or "Chatbots" on the news, and it might sound complicated or a bit strange. That's perfectly okay! The goal of this guide is to show you that, at its heart, this is a simple, powerful, and even fun tool that can make your days a little easier and more interesting.

Imagine having a conversation with a person who has read every book, seen every movie, and knows a little something about everything. You could ask them for a recipe, to explain a tricky concept, or even to help you write a nice birthday message. That's what using an AI Chatbot like Gemini or ChatGPT is like.

It's just a conversation. You ask, and it answers. Let's get started.

---

### **Part 1: So, What Is This Thing, Really?**

An AI Chatbot is simply a computer program designed to understand and respond to your typed questions in a conversational way.

- **It's NOT a person.** It doesn't have feelings, opinions, or a personality. It's a tool, like a calculator or a search engine.
    
- **It's a "know-it-all" in a good way.** Its knowledge comes from a vast amount of information from books, websites, and articles. This makes it great for answering questions, summarizing information, and brainstorming ideas.
    
- **It can be creative.** It can write poems, suggest movie plots, or help you come up with ideas for a project.
    

> **A Little Encouragement:** Learning something new at any age is an act of courage and curiosity. Be patient with yourself. There's no "wrong" way to ask a question, and every conversation you have with the AI will help you get better at it. This is a tool for _you_, to serve _your_ interests.

---

### **Part 2: The Art of the Ask (How to Create a Good Prompt)**

"Prompt" is just a fancy word for the question or instruction you give to the AI. The secret to getting a great answer is to give a great prompt. You don't need to be a computer scientist; you just need to be clear.

Think of it like ordering at a restaurant.

- A **not-so-good** prompt is like saying, "Give me food." You'll get _something_, but probably not what you wanted.
    
- A **good prompt** is like saying, "I'd like a medium-rare cheeseburger with lettuce and tomato, no onions, and a side of fries." You'll get exactly what you're hoping for.
    

The best prompts have three simple ingredients. Let's call them the **CPR** of prompting: **Context, Purpose, and Role.**

1. **Context (The "Who" and "What"):** Give it some background. What are you talking about? The more details, the better.
    
2. **Purpose (The "Why"):** What do you want it to _do_? Do you want it to explain something, list ideas, summarize an article, or write something for you?
    
3. **Role (The "How"):** This is a fun one! You can tell the AI _how_ to act. For example, "Explain this to me like I'm a complete beginner" or "Act like a movie critic."
    

Let's see it in action.

|**Simple Prompt (Okay)**|**CPR Prompt (Much Better!)**|
|---|---|
|Tell me about cameras.|**(Context)** I have a digital camera and want to take better pictures of my model trains. **(Purpose)** Can you explain the concept of 'depth of field' **(Role)** in simple, easy-to-understand terms for a beginner?|
|What should I read?|**(Context)** I enjoy reading mystery novels and I'm looking for a new author. I've read all of Agatha Christie's books. **(Purpose)** Can you give me a list of five other authors who write similar "cozy mystery" stories, **(Role)** and give a one-sentence summary for one of their most popular books?|

See the difference? The CPR prompt gives the AI all the clues it needs to give you a truly helpful answer.

### **Part 3: Your Turn to Try! (Ideas Just for You)**

This is where the fun begins. The best way to learn is by doing. Here are some personalized ideas. You can copy and paste these directly into an AI chat (like Google's Gemini) and see what happens!

#### **For Mom: A World of Information & Entertainment**

Your morning routine of reading articles just got a superpower. Instead of just reading what's presented, you can now ask for exactly what you want.

- **Prompt Idea 1 (Home Improvement):** "I'm thinking of repainting my living room. The walls are currently a light beige, and I get a lot of morning sun. Can you give me 5 color suggestions that would create a warm and cozy feeling? Please list the color names and a short description of the mood each one creates."
    
- **Prompt Idea 2 (Entertainment):** "I just finished watching the latest season of 'The Crown'. Can you give me a list of 3 other historical drama TV shows I might enjoy? For each show, tell me what it's about and why someone who likes 'The Crown' would like it."
    
- **Prompt Idea 3 (Summarizing):** Find a long news article online, copy the text, and then prompt the AI: "Please summarize this article for me in three simple bullet points."
    

#### **For Dad: Diving Deeper into Your Passions**

This is your personal research assistant, ready to explore the details of your hobbies with you.

- **Prompt Idea 1 (Lionel Trains):** "I am a fan of Lionel model trains from the post-war era. Can you tell me the history of the 'Santa Fe F3' diesel locomotive set? What made it so popular when it was released?"
    
- **Prompt Idea 2 (Music):** "Create a 15-song playlist of relaxing classic rock from the late 1960s and early 1970s. I enjoy artists like James Taylor and The Eagles. Please include the artist and the song title."
    
- **Prompt Idea 3 (Cameras):** "Explain the 'exposure triangle' (Aperture, Shutter Speed, and ISO) for a beginner photographer. Use an analogy to make it easy to understand, like filling a bucket with water."
    

---

### **A Final Thought: Your New Partner in Curiosity**

The most important thing to remember is that this is _your_ tool. There is no pressure to be perfect. Be curious. Ask silly questions. Ask serious ones. Use it to learn one new thing every day. Use it to settle a dinner table debate. Use it to plan a garden.

You have a lifetime of experience, wisdom, and interests. This technology is simply a new way to explore all of it. Have fun, and enjoy the conversation.

---

### **To Help Me Help You Better**

This guide is a strong first step, but to make it absolutely perfect for your parents, a few more details from you would be incredibly helpful. You don't need to answer all of these, but anything you can provide will allow me to tailor it even more precisely to their needs:

1. **Tech Comfort Level:** On a scale of 1 (avoids computers) to 10 (very comfortable), where would you place your Mom and Dad individually? This will help me know whether to include more basic steps, like how to open the website and find the text box.
    
2. **Specific Hesitations:** Have they ever expressed any specific worries or skepticism about AI or new technology? Knowing their concerns can help me address them directly and gently in the guide.
    
3. **Learning Style:** Do they prefer reading, or would they be better served with something that has more pictures or even a simple script for a video you could record for them?
    
4. **The "Why" For Them:** Besides the general benefits, is there a specific, immediate problem or task you think this could solve for them? (e.g., "My dad is always trying to find repair manuals for his trains," or "My mom would love an easier way to find new recipes.")
    

Your dedication to helping them is truly admirable. We'll work together to make sure they feel confident, capable, and ready to explore.

### Pur3v4d3r Responds:

#1 Tech comfort level
Mom: 3-5
Dad: 5-7

#2 Specific Hesitations
No not really

#3 Learning Style
Reading for sure but feel free to mix in some visuals as it will break of the monotony of a wall of text on paper.

#4 The Why
Mom: Currently she is looking for a new paint color for her bedroom. One color she asked me about is called "Shark-Fin-Grey" by "Bear" I believe. She's always reading so something to help her find books or tv shows is a good idea also.
Dad: Has been looking into some new models of Nikon mirrorless cameras or the D850 DSLR. He likes to watch free public television with an receiving antenna to. And enjoys researching new products when he needs something new. For example He recently helped my mom pick out a new dishwasher (Which I know would have been more fun and a better experience like more informative if he was using AI to help.) Don't bring it up directly but he like to find a good deal.

### Gemini Responds:

Thank you. This is incredibly helpful. Knowing these specific details about their comfort levels and interests allows me to transform the guide from a general template into a truly personal and effective tool for them. It's the difference between a generic map and a hand-drawn guide with "you are here" marked on it.

Here is the revised and much more personalized version of the course.

|---|---|
|Tell me about Nikon cameras.|**(Context)** I enjoy photography as a hobby and currently use a DSLR. I'm considering buying either the Nikon D850 or a newer mirrorless camera. **(Purpose)** Can you compare them for me? **(Role)** Put the results in a simple table so I can see the pros and cons of each.|
|What color should I paint my room?|**(Context)** I'm re-painting my bedroom and want a relaxing color. I saw a Behr paint color called 'Sharkfin' that I like. **(Purpose)** Can you suggest three other paint colors that would complement 'Sharkfin'? **(Role)** Describe the feeling each complementary color would create.|

The CPR prompt gives the AI all the clues it needs to give you a truly helpful answer.

Of course. This is fantastic feedback—it makes perfect sense. These refinements are exactly what will make the guide feel less like a document and more like a personal letter. Sharpening the examples and adding that layer of empowerment is a brilliant touch.

Here is the newly revised guide with all of your requested changes integrated.

1. **Context:** Give it some background. The more details, the better.
    
2. **Purpose:** What do you want it to _do_? Explain, list, compare, summarize?
    
3. **Role:** Tell it _how_ to act. "Explain this to me like I'm a beginner."[^8]
[^8]: I like that there is an sop for them to follow I'm just concerned that this is the only way in witch the will write their prompts.

Let's see it in action with new, tailored examples:[^9]

|**Simple Prompt (Okay)**|**CPR Prompt (Much Better!)**|
|---|---|
|Tell me about Nikon cameras.|**(Context)** I enjoy photography as a hobby and currently use a DSLR. I'm considering buying either the Nikon D850 or a newer mirrorless camera. **(Purpose)** Can you compare them for me? **(Role)** Put the results in a simple table so I can see the pros and cons of each.|
|What color should I paint my room?|**(Context)** I'm re-painting my bedroom and want a relaxing color. I saw a Behr paint color called 'Sharkfin' that I like. **(Purpose)** Can you suggest three other paint colors that would complement 'Sharkfin'? **(Role)** Describe the feeling each complementary color would create.|
[^9]: Make this table more clearly state what it purpose is.

> For example, you could type:
> 
> "I want to ask about flowers for my garden. Can you help me write a better prompt? I live in Jacksonville, Florida, I have a shady backyard, and I want low-maintenance perennial flowers."
> 
> The AI might suggest a much more detailed prompt for you to use, like:
> 
> "I'm looking for low-maintenance perennial flower recommendations for a shady backyard in Jacksonville, Florida (USDA Zone 9a). Please suggest 5 different flowers, including their light and water requirements."[^10]
[^10]: This doesn't make it seem that the AI did much of anything make the changes more detailed and pronounced.


**Prompt for TV Recommendations:** "I'm looking for a new drama series to watch. I enjoy shows with a lot of heart and great characters. Can you recommend 3 shows that are similar to 'This Is Us' or 'A Million Little Things'? Please give a short summary of what each one is about."[^11]
[^11]: Some shows she likes are:
	The Last Ship
	Bones
	
	The past couple of nights and maybe even weeks she's been watching movies, a mix of everything but some older classics is what she's been watching.
	This is the List of her last movies watched:
	Twilight-Breaking Dawn
	Game of thrones
	The Last ship
	Jurassic World
	New Moon 2
	Jurassic world fallen kingdom
	Jurassic world dominion

### Gemini Responds

This is excellent. Your notes are crystal clear, and this level of detail is precisely what elevates a good guide into a great one. You're not just giving them instructions; you're giving them understanding and context. I completely agree with all of your proposed changes. Let's build this definitive version.

Here is the thoroughly revised guide, incorporating all of your insights and additions.

### A Simple Guide to AI Chatbots and Using them to Impact Day to Day activities


This is a guide I wrote for you. Its purpose is to get you up to speed on the use of an AI chatbot. The reason for me doing this is because, I would like to share with you all the benefits that AI has to offer. I know, that the use of these technologies and tools is one that could and would positively benefit your daily life.

You might have heard about "AI" or "Chatbots," and it might sound complicated. That's perfectly fine. My goal is to show you the benefits of a technology that has been at the forefront of the Technology World since 2020 when the world really took a look at the usefulness of AI.

Interestingly, I created this guide by working with an AI myself. I gave it a rough but still detailed request, explaining what I wanted to accomplish. Then, through a series of conversations and iterative refinements (like the ones this guide will teach you), we worked together to create a rough outline of what I wanted to say, I then took this information and composed / Wrote the document you're reading now. It’s a perfect example of how these tools work: they are partners in a process, helping to shape an idea into a final product. And just a mere single use of the limitless of this technology, given that it is treated with the upmost respect, and ethics, that mankind can muster.

---

### **Part 1: So, What Is This Thing, Really?**

An AI Chatbot is at the core, is just computer program you can have a conversation with. You type a question or an instruction (the prompt), and it types back an answer. The instruction you give it is called a **"prompt."** Think of a prompt as the starting point of your conversation.

**You may be asking** "***Yeah, but How does It know, at all?***" Which is a good question, and it isn't a complicated process perse, but it is very technical. Basically LLM Engineers will construct the AI framework and the start to "**Train**" the model. This training isn't that different then how you or I would learn over time. The AI is instructed to read thousands and thousands of books, articles, and other types of information, along with all sorts of other useful datasets. and visual information. Over time the AI will recognize patterns of language and information, effectively learning or remembering this information. When you give the AI a prompt or question it uses its training to recognize patterns and predict the most logical and helpful sequence of words to form an answer for you, and can openly talk with you. Yes, it is **WAY** more advanced then that, but that is outside the scope of this paper.

This is what makes it so powerful:

- **It's a "know-it-all" in a good way.** Because its knowledge comes from such a vast source, it's fantastic for answering questions, comparing products, generating text, and brainstorming ideas on almost any topic you can imagine.
    
- **It's a creative partner.** It can help you find the perfect paint color, create a list of TV shows to watch, or Music to listen to, or even help you with ideas for your gardens.
    
- **It's NOT a person.** This is the most important thing to remember. It doesn't have feelings, beliefs, or personal experiences. It's a very sophisticated tool, like a calculator or a search engine, designed to help you.
    

> **Tip:** Learning something new is an act of curiosity. Be patient with yourself. There is no "wrong" way to ask a question, and every conversation you have will make you more comfortable. This is a tool for _you_, to serve _your_ interests.

---

### **Part 2: The Art of the Ask (How to Create a Good Prompt)**

"Prompt" is just the word for the question or instruction you give the AI. The secret to getting a great answer is to ask a clear question. The more details and specific clues you provide in your prompt, the better the AI can understand exactly what you're looking for. Think of it like being a detective: the more clues you give the AI, the faster it can solve the case.

To help you think about what details to include, here is a helpful mental checklist called **CPR**: **Context**, **Purpose**, and **Role**.

You absolutely do not need to use all three parts every time, and you don't need to write your prompts in this order. Think of them as ingredients you can add to make your request clearer and more powerful.

1. **Context:** Give it some background. The more details, the better.
    
2. **Purpose:** What do you want it to _do_? Explain, list, compare, summarize?
    
3. **Role:** Tell it _how_ to act. By giving it a Persona. This is an optional but powerful trick. 
	
	**A Few Examples for you:**
	
	- You are a Master gardener and you excel at communicating with others, you have an act for knowing the right time to plant and when to harvest. You are enthusiastic and outgoing.
	- You are a personal shopper who is masterful at finding deals. You always go above and beyond for you clients.
	- You are an avid academic scholar who specializes in the field of \[XXXX] (Fill in the X's) Who is adept in the art of communicating with others and excel at explaining complex ideas in an understandable and relatable way.


Here’s a side-by-side look at how adding these details transforms a simple question into a powerful request:

|**Simple Prompt (Okay)**|**CPR Prompt (Much Better!)**|
|---|---|
|Tell me about Nikon cameras.|**(Context)** I enjoy photography as a hobby and currently use a DSLR. I'm considering buying either the Nikon D850 or a newer mirrorless camera. **(Purpose)** Can you compare them for me? **(Role)** Put the results in a simple table so I can see the pros and cons of each.|
|What color should I paint my room?|**(Context)** I'm re-painting my bedroom and want a relaxing color. I saw a Behr paint color called 'Sharkfin' that I like. **(Purpose)** Can you suggest three other paint colors that would complement 'Sharkfin'? **(Role)** Describe the feeling each complementary color would create.|

### **Part 3: Your Turn to Try! (Ideas Just for You)**

This is where it gets really useful. Here are some personalized ideas you can try.

> Your Secret Weapon: Ask the AI to Be Your Prompt Coach.
> 
> If you're ever unsure if your question is clear enough, or you don't quite know what you want to say, or you just want to make your prompts better in general. You can ask the AI to improve it for you! It's simple, all you have to do is write your purposed prompt in the chat, beginning with *"I'm working on this prompt can you re work so its the best it can be?"*
> 
> For example, you could type this simple idea into the chat:
> 
> "I need a better prompt to ask about my garden. I live in Jacksonville, Florida, my backyard is shady, and I want low-maintenance perennial flowers that are colorful."
> 
> The AI can then act as your coach, turning your idea into a super-detailed prompt you can use, like this:
> 
> "Act as a master gardener. I am looking for recommendations for colorful, low-maintenance perennial flowers that thrive in a shady backyard in Jacksonville, Florida (USDA Zone 9a). Please suggest 5 distinct flower types. For each one, include its peak blooming season, water requirements, and what colors it comes in. Also, mention if they are resistant to common Florida pests."
