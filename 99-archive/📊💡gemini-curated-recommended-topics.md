> In **Gemini's settings** I have set up the *ability* for **Gemini** to *recall information about me and on our past conversations, history, Etc*. The way in which I have set it up is for **Gemini** to always **recommend future readings/Related Topics** for me to continue researching. 
> 
> I have done this for the purpose of having Gemini effectively continuously both *Brainstorm Ideas that are analogous of the current topic* or subject and so that I acquire an endless supply of *future research material*. For those times when nothing seems worth researching, or you can't come up with a valid topic *These topics have been basically curated through many chats all on subjects that I am actively engaging with.*

The workflow we've designed here is a perfect example of manual prompt chaining. You could investigate ways to automate this process, perhaps using scripts or tools like `Templater` and `QuickAdd` in Obsidian to take the output from the Topic Generator and automatically trigger the Exposition Gem.                                                                                      |                                                                                   |

Researching formal systems of knowledge organization, like creating a personal taxonomy (hierarchical classification) or ontology (a model of concepts and their relations), can help you structure your PKB for maximum insight and navigability.                                                                                                                             |                                                                                   |

It emphasizes true understanding over rote memorization by forcing you to explain complex topics in simple terms, a principle that is at the heart of your Gem's mission. Exploring this technique can improve both how you learn from the generated reports and how you formulate future prompts.                                    |                                                                                   |

Learning some basic CSS allows you to tailor every visual aspect of the application, from the colors of headings and links to creating complex multi-column layouts, making your PKB truly your own.                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                   |

You can perform calculations, create dynamic charts, and build highly specific dashboards that go far beyond the capabilities of the standard query language.                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                   |

This is the key to integrating Obsidian with other tools like macro pads, system-wide automation software, or even scripts.                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                   |

Think about a process from start to finish—for instance, a "Book Notes" workflow. It might start with a QuickAdd command, which runs a Templater template, which contains Meta Bind controls for progress, and whose data is ultimately displayed on a dashboard via Dataview. Considering the entire lifecycle of a note is the hallmark of a truly advanced PKB architect. |                                                                                   |
