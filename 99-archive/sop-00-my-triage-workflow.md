**My Triage Workflow/SOP**

1. **Capture the raw material.**
2. **Copy the information.**
3. **Open Obsidian.**
4. **Create a new note.**
5. **Paste the copied information into the new note.**
6. **Review the new information** to ensure nothing was altered during the transfer.
7. **Fix any mistakes as necessary.**
8. **Add code blocks** where appropriate.
9. **Rename the note** according to the naming convention.
   - Note: From now on, use dashes instead of spaces for note titles and file/folder names.
10. **Shift the top section** to the appropriate positions.
    - Leave 3 spaces from the top to start the properties section.
    - Include 1 space or a blank line between each element.
    - Allow everything sufficient space to breathe.
11. **Add the purpose of the note** using the appropriate callout format.
12. **Go to the note with Copilot prompts.**
13. **Copy the prompt** for generating the YAML front matter.
14. **Paste the copied content** into the Copilot Smart Chat.
15. **Clear the current file** in preparation for dispatch to the [[LLM]].
16. **Choose the correct file**, which will be titled after the note.
17. **Send the prompt and information** to the [[LLM]].
18. **Wait for a response;** this can take a few seconds.
19. **After receiving the response:**
    - Copy the response.
    - Paste the response at the very top of the new note; it must be the first line for it to work correctly.
20. **Perform a final inspection** of the note.
    - Fix any lingering mistakes.
21. **Return to your previous task.**

This is a temporary workflow. Think of it as a triage process that will help us manage until we implement a more comprehensive system, which will include tools like QuickAdd, Templater, Dataview, and other plugins that offer valuable synergistic benefits.
