> [!the-purpose]
> **This note provides a complete, hierarchical Tag Taxonomy for the Knowledge Work & Personal Knowledge Management domain of your PKB.** This is your meta-layer—the taxonomy for organizing notes *about* organizing notes, for managing knowledge *about* knowledge management. It covers PKM theory, PKB architecture, note-taking methodologies, tools, workflows, and knowledge work practices.

> [!core-principle]
> **Design Philosophy:** This taxonomy treats knowledge management as both a **theoretical discipline** (with methodologies, frameworks, and research) and a **practical craft** (with tools, techniques, and workflows). It enables you to document your evolving PKM system while also capturing insights from the broader field of knowledge management.

---

## 📚 Taxonomy Overview

This taxonomy organizes the **Knowledge Work & Personal Knowledge Management** domain into a three-level hierarchical structure:

```
#domain/subdomain/concept
```

**Meta-note:** This taxonomy is self-referential—it's the system you'll use to organize notes about building this system. Embrace the recursion.

> ```yaml
> tags:
>   - pkm/principles/atomic-notes
>   - note-taking/zettelkasten/principles
>   - concept/atomic-notes
>   - type/framework
> ```

## 🎓 Tag Usage Guidelines

> [!core-principle]
> **Consistency Protocol for PKM Domain:**

### Rule 1: Meta-Documentation Standard
Every system component (workflow, template, configuration) should have documentation tagged appropriately:
- The component itself (e.g., a Templater script)
- Documentation about the component (tagged `#type/reference`)
- Reflections on using the component (tagged `#type/reflection`)

### Rule 2: Distinction Between Tool and Practice
- Use `#obsidian/` tags for tool-specific implementation
- Use `#pkm/` or `#knowledge-workflow/` for methodology that transcends any specific tool
- Example: "How to create atomic notes" = `#pkm/principles/atomic-notes`
- Example: "Using Obsidian's block references" = `#obsidian/core-features/linking`

### Rule 3: Methodology vs. Implementation
- Tag notes about *theories and frameworks* with methodology tags
- Tag notes about *actually doing it* with workflow tags
- Example: "PARA Method explained" = `#productivity/para` + `#type/framework`
- Example: "My PARA implementation" = `#productivity/para` + `#pkb/architecture` + `#type/practice-log`

### Rule 4: Avoid Tool Brand Proliferation
- Keep tool-specific tags under the `#obsidian/` hierarchy
- Don't create separate top-level tags for every plugin
- Bad: `#dataview`, `#templater`, `#quickadd`
- Good: `#obsidian/plugins/dataview`, `#obsidian/plugins/templater`

### Rule 5: Context Tags for Meta-Work
When working on the system itself (vs. using the system), use `#context/meta`:
```yaml
# Working on improving the tag system:
tags:
  - type/reflection
  - pkb/metadata/tags
  - context/meta

# Actually using tags in normal workflow:
tags:
  - type/literature
  - cognitive-science/metacognition
  - context/theoretical
```

### Rule 6: Status Matters for Documentation
System documentation should have clear status tags:
- `#status/evergreen` = Authoritative, current documentation
- `#status/review` = Potentially outdated, needs verification
- `#status/archived` = Historical record, no longer active

---

## 🔄 Tag Maintenance Schedule

> [!methodology-and-sources]
> **Quarterly Maintenance for PKM Domain:**

### Every 3 Months: System Health Check

**Step 1: Documentation Coverage Analysis**
```dataviewjs
let workflows = dv.pages('#knowledge-workflow').length
let obsidianDocs = dv.pages('#obsidian').length
let pkbDesign = dv.pages('#pkb').length
let pkmTheory = dv.pages('#pkm').length

dv.table(["Domain", "Note Count"], [
    ["Knowledge Workflows", workflows],
    ["Obsidian Documentation", obsidianDocs],
    ["PKB Architecture", pkbDesign],
    ["PKM Theory", pkmTheory],
    ["Total PKM Domain", workflows + obsidianDocs + pkbDesign + pkmTheory]
])
```

**Step 2: Identify Outdated Documentation**
```dataview
TABLE file.mtime as "Last Modified", status
FROM #obsidian OR #pkb/maintenance
WHERE file.mtime < date(today) - dur(180 days)
SORT file.mtime ASC
```

**Step 3: Find Documentation Gaps**
Review your actual workflows and ask:
- Which workflows do I use daily that lack documentation?
- Which plugins do I rely on without reference notes?
- What system components have implicit but not explicit rules?

**Step 4: Update Terminology**
As PKM language evolves, update your terminology:
- Check for deprecated terms (e.g., "Roam-like linking" → "bidirectional linking")
- Consolidate synonyms (e.g., `#pkm/second-brain` + `#concept/second-brain`)
- Update to current best practices

---

## 📖 Semantic Definitions: Deep Dive

> [!definition]
> **Detailed Tag Meanings for PKM Domain:**

### `#pkm/methodology/zettelkasten`
**Definition:** The slip-box method developed by Niklas Luhmann, emphasizing atomic notes, dense linking, and emergence through sustained note-taking practice.

**Use for:**
- Notes about Zettelkasten principles and philosophy
- Literature notes from Ahrens, Luhmann, or other ZK theorists
- Analysis of ZK practice and effectiveness
- Comparison of ZK to other methodologies

**Do NOT use for:**
- Generic linking practices (use ``#knowledge-graph/linking`)`
- The mere fact that you use Obsidian (which happens to support ZK)
- Every permanent note (only tag notes *about* the methodology)

---

### `#pkb/architecture`
**Definition:** The structural design and organizational framework of your Personal Knowledge Base, including hierarchy, folder structure, and high-level organization principles.

**Use for:**
- Notes documenting your PKB's overall structure
- Decisions about folder organization
- Hierarchy and taxonomy design
- Architectural patterns and rationales

**Do NOT use for:**
- Individual component types like MOCs (use `#pkb/components/moc`)
- Metadata specifics (use ``#pkb/metadata/`)`
- General information architecture theory (use ``#information-architecture/`)`

---

`### #obsidian/plugins/dataview`
**Definition:** Content specifically about the Dataview plugin for Obsidian, including queries, configuration, and best practices.

**Use for:**
- Dataview query examples and templates
- DQL (Dataview Query Language) syntax reference
- DataviewJS scripts and techniques
- Plugin configuration and troubleshooting

**Do NOT use for:**
- Generic database or query concepts (use appropriate computer science tags)
- Notes that happen to contain a Dataview query but aren't *about* Dataview

---

### `#knowledge-workflow/synthesis`
**Definition:** The process of integrating, connecting, and creating new insights from multiple information sources; the phase where original thinking emerges from collected material.

**Use for:**
- Techniques for connecting disparate ideas
- Methods for creating synthesis notes
- Practices that enable emergent insights
- Tools and workflows that facilitate integration

**Do NOT use for:**
- Simply linking two notes together (that's just linking)
- Literature review or summarization (that's processing, not synthesis)
- The output of synthesis (tag those notes ``#type/synthesis` or `#type/permanent`)`

---

`### #pkb/philosophy`
**Definition:** The underlying principles and mindset of digital gardening: learning in public, embracing imperfection, showing work-in-progress, and cultivating ideas over time.

**Use for:**
- Notes about the philosophy of working in public
- Reflections on sharing imperfect work
- The metaphor of gardening applied to knowledge work
- Cultural aspects of digital gardening communities

**Do NOT use for:**
`- Technical implementation of publishing tools (use `#pkb`)
- Note maturation practices in private PKBs (use `#pkm/workflow/`)
- General evergreen note practices (use `#pkm/principles/evergreen-notes`)
`

## ⚠️ Common Tagging Mistakes in This Domain

> [!warning]
> **Anti-Patterns to Avoid in PKM Tagging:**

### ❌ Mistake 1: Confusing the Map with the Territory

**Bad:**
```yaml
# A note about cognitive psychology
tags:
  - pkm
  - note-taking
```

**Good:**
```yaml
# A note about cognitive psychology
tags:
  - cognitive-science/memory
  - type/literature
```

**Why:** PKM tags describe notes *about knowledge management*, not notes *managed by* your knowledge system. Every note in your PKB is managed by PKM—that doesn't mean every note should be tagged `#pkm`.

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: Tool-Specific When Methodology Applies

**Bad:**
```yaml
# A note about linking practices in general
tags:
  - obsidian/core-features/linking
```

**Good:**
```yaml
# A note about linking practices in general
tags:
  - knowledge-graph/linking
  - pkm/principles/linking-thinking
  - concept/bidirectional-linking
```

**Why:** Linking is a methodology that transcends Obsidian. Only use `#obsidian/` tags for Obsidian-specific implementation details.

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: Documentation About Practice, Not the Practice Itself

**Bad:**
```yaml
# Documentation explaining your weekly review
tags:
  - type/practice-log
```

**Good:**
```yaml
# Documentation explaining your weekly review
tags:
  - type/framework
  - knowledge-workflow/review/weekly-review
  - status/evergreen
```

**Why:** `#type/practice-log` is for records of doing the practice, not for documentation of how to do it.

---

### ❌ Mistake 4: Over-Tagging System Components

**Bad:**
```yaml
# A Templater script file
tags:
  - obsidian/plugins/templater
  - obsidian/advanced/templater-scripts
  - automation
  - workflow
  - pkm
  - productivity
```

**Good:**
```yaml
# A Templater script file
tags:
  - type/template
  - obsidian/plugins/templater
```

**Why:** Templates and scripts are functional components. Keep tagging minimal and specific.

---

### ❌ Mistake 5: Meta Confusion

**Bad:**
```yaml
# A note about your tag taxonomy (like this one!)
tags:
  - type/reference
  - pkb/metadata/tags
```

**Good:**
```yaml
# A note about your tag taxonomy (like this one!)
tags:
  - type/reference
  - pkb/metadata/tags
  - context/meta
  - status/evergreen
```

**Why:** Always add `#context/meta` when a note is about the system itself. This distinguishes meta-work from regular work.

---

### ❌ Mistake 6: Plugin Proliferation

**Bad:**
Creating separate top-level tags:
```yaml
tags:
  - dataview
  - templater
  - quickadd
  - calendar
```

**Good:**
Using the plugin hierarchy:
```yaml
tags:
  - obsidian/plugins/dataview
  - obsidian/plugins/templater
```

**Why:** Keeps your tag namespace clean and makes it clear these are tool-specific, not conceptual categories.

<thinking>
The user wants a complete tag taxonomy similar to the Cognitive Abilities one, but this time focused on the domain of knowledge work, PKM, PKB, and knowledge management. This is a meta-domain - it's about the systems and practices for managing knowledge itself.

I need to create a comprehensive hierarchical taxonomy covering:
- Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) theory and practice
- Personal Knowledge Base (PKB) architecture and design
- Knowledge management more broadly
- Information architecture
- Note-taking methodologies (Zettelkasten, PARA, etc.)
- Tools and systems (Obsidian, plugins, workflows)
- Knowledge work practices
- Information literacy
- Digital garden concepts
- Learning systems
- Productivity systems as they relate to knowledge work

The structure should mirror the cognitive abilities taxonomy with:
1. Complete hierarchical tag structure (3 levels deep)
2. Multi-dimensional tagging framework
3. Practical examples
4. Dataview queries
5. MOC template
6. Usage guidelines
7. Semantic definitions
8. Common mistakes
9. Implementation checklist

This is a meta-domain about the very system the user is building, so it needs to be especially well-organized and self-referential.

Key domains to include:
- PKM/PKB theory and methodology
- Note-taking systems (Zettelkasten, etc.)
- Information architecture
- Knowledge workflows
- Tools and technology (Obsidian ecosystem)
- Knowledge capture and processing
- Knowledge synthesis and creation
- Knowledge retrieval and discovery
- Knowledge sharing and publishing
- Digital gardening
- Productivity systems for knowledge work
</thinking>
