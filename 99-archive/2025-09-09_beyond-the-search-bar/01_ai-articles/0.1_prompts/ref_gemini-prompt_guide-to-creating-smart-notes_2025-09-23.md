### ## Primary Objective



To develop a comprehensive guide and a repeatable workflow for creating highly effective notes within a Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) system. This guide must cover the visual and informational structure of a note, transforming it from a simple text file into a functional, interconnected piece of knowledge.



### ## AI Persona



Embody the persona of an expert Information Architect and Knowledge Management Strategist. You specialize in designing elegant, efficient systems for thinking and learning. Your explanations are grounded in first principles, exceptionally clear, and always focused on practical application. You anticipate the user's needs and provide actionable frameworks, not just isolated tips.



### ## Core Directives & Required Sections



Conduct a thorough synthesis of best practices to create a definitive guide on note architecture. The final document must be structured with the following sections:

**1. Section 1: The Philosophy of a "Smart Note"**

- Briefly explain the core philosophy: Why is note structure important?
- Define the purpose of a good note: It should be a tool for **future thinking**, not just a repository for past information.
- Explain the concept of the "atomic note" (one idea per note) as the foundational principle.

**2. Section 2: The Visual Architecture (Clarity for the Eyes)**

- Provide a detailed breakdown of the visual elements that reduce cognitive load.
- Explain the function and best practices for each of the following:
  - Descriptive Titles
  - The One-Sentence Summary Block
  - Headings and Subheadings
  - Strategic Formatting (**Bold**, *Italics*, `Highlights`)
  - The proper use of Bulleted vs. Numbered Lists
  - The importance of White Space

**3. Section 3: The Informational Architecture (Clarity for the Brain)**

- Detail the components that make a note functional and interconnected.
- Explain the purpose and provide examples for:
  - **Metadata / Frontmatter:** Explain its role in organization and searchability. Detail common fields like `tags`, `aliases`, `source`, and `created`.
  - **Contextual Linking:** Explain *how* to link between notes. Emphasize the importance of writing a sentence that provides context for the link, rather than just inserting the link itself.
  - **The "Related Notes" Section:** Explain its function as a curated discovery tool.

**4. Section 4: The Universal Note Template**

- Based on the principles above, provide a practical, copy-and-paste Markdown template for a perfect note.
- The template must include clear placeholders (e.g., `[Descriptive Title Here]`, `[1-2 sentence summary in your own words.]`) for every key component, including the metadata frontmatter.

**5. Section 5: The Workflow (Standard Operating Procedure)**

- Provide a simple, step-by-step SOP for creating a new note using the template.
- This workflow should guide the user from the moment an idea strikes to the final, well-structured note. For example:
  1. Create a new note and paste the template.
  2. Fill in the title and source.
  3. Write the main content (the "braindump").
  4. **Refactor:** Structure the content using headings, lists, and formatting.
  5. **Synthesize:** Write the one-sentence summary at the top.
  6. **Connect:** Add contextual links and fill out the "Related Notes" section.
  7. Finalize metadata (tags, aliases).



### ## Output Requirements



- **Format:** A well-organized and clearly written document using Markdown. Use headings, bold text, and code blocks for the template and examples to ensure high readability.
- **Tone:** Maintain the persona of an authoritative yet encouraging expert. The guide should feel empowering and actionable.
