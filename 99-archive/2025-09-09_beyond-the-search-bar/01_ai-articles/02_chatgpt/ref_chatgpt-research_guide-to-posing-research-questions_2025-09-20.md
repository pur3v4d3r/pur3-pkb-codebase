# Formulating Research Questions and Topics

Begin by choosing a **broad subject of interest**, then gradually narrow it to a focused question. For example, start with a topic like “social media and mental health,” then read background literature to spot gaps or specific angles. Brainstorm keywords or sub‑topics using concept maps or the “Who/What/Where/When/How/Why” questions[\[1\]](https://www.gvsu.edu/library/km/brainstorming-strategy-narrowing-a-topic-36.htm#:~:text=Brainstorming%20is%20the%20process%20by,down%20the%20topic%20is%20needed). As GVSU advises, _narrowing your topic is essential_ because a very broad topic is hard to research[\[1\]](https://www.gvsu.edu/library/km/brainstorming-strategy-narrowing-a-topic-36.htm#:~:text=Brainstorming%20is%20the%20process%20by,down%20the%20topic%20is%20needed). You might start by listing related terms (e.g. “Instagram,” “adolescents,” “anxiety”), then combine them into a tentative question. A structured approach is:  
1\. **Identify a topic:** Write your broad area (e.g. _use of social media and children_)[\[1\]](https://www.gvsu.edu/library/km/brainstorming-strategy-narrowing-a-topic-36.htm#:~:text=Brainstorming%20is%20the%20process%20by,down%20the%20topic%20is%20needed).  
2\. **Preliminary research:** Read reviews or articles to see what is known and what remains unanswered[\[2\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30686882/#:~:text=relationship%2C%20comparative%2C%20and%20causality,a%20RQ%20and%20then%20evaluates).  
3\. **Narrow the focus:** Use brainstorming or free‑writing (e.g. concept maps) to find a specific angle[\[1\]](https://www.gvsu.edu/library/km/brainstorming-strategy-narrowing-a-topic-36.htm#:~:text=Brainstorming%20is%20the%20process%20by,down%20the%20topic%20is%20needed). Answer _who/what/where/when/how/why_ to refine the topic. For instance, using this method “social media and children” became _“What are the effects of using Instagram on the behavior of adolescents?”_[\[3\]](https://www.gvsu.edu/library/km/brainstorming-strategy-narrowing-a-topic-36.htm#:~:text=Narrow%20research%20question%3A%20What%20are,Instagram%20on%20the%C2%A0behavior%20of%20adolescents).  
4\. **Formulate an open-ended question:** Turn your refined idea into a question that does **not** presuppose an answer. Start with _How_, _Why_, _What_, etc., rather than yes/no. For example, rather than asking “Is social media causing anxiety in youth?”, ask “How does social media affect anxiety in young people?”[\[4\]](https://www.sjsu.edu/writingcenter/docs/handouts/Research%20Questions.pdf#:~:text=Example%20Topic%3A%20Emperor%20Penguins%20and,It%20is)[\[5\]](https://www.sjsu.edu/writingcenter/docs/handouts/Research%20Questions.pdf#:~:text=Finally%2C%20a%20research%20question%20should,%E2%80%9Cwhy%E2%80%9D%20in%20their%20research%20question). This helps avoid bias and invites exploration.  
5\. **Refine and check:** Review your draft question for clarity and scope. Avoid vague terms or overly broad scope[\[6\]](https://www.sjsu.edu/writingcenter/docs/handouts/Research%20Questions.pdf#:~:text=Example%20Unclear%20Research%20Question%3A%20How,a%20researchable%20topic%20within%20the)[\[7\]](https://www.scribbr.com/research-process/research-questions/#:~:text=All%20research%20questions%20should%20be%3A), and remove any leading assumptions. (The SJSU guide warns that a question like _“How is social media leading to increased anxiety?”_ is poor because it assumes the effect[\[8\]](https://www.sjsu.edu/writingcenter/docs/handouts/Research%20Questions.pdf#:~:text=Note%20that%20you%20are%20not,leading%20to%20an%20increase%20in).)

These steps can be iterative: you may repeat narrowing and reading until the question is clear and focused.

## Key Qualities of a Good Research Question

A strong research question is _focused_ and _specific_, _answerable_, _open-ended_, and _significant_. It should address one clear issue and use precise terms[\[6\]](https://www.sjsu.edu/writingcenter/docs/handouts/Research%20Questions.pdf#:~:text=Example%20Unclear%20Research%20Question%3A%20How,a%20researchable%20topic%20within%20the)[\[7\]](https://www.scribbr.com/research-process/research-questions/#:~:text=All%20research%20questions%20should%20be%3A). It must be **answerable** (researchable) using available methods within your resources and time[\[7\]](https://www.scribbr.com/research-process/research-questions/#:~:text=All%20research%20questions%20should%20be%3A)[\[9\]](https://www.scribbr.com/research-process/research-questions/#:~:text=Feasible%20and%20specific). It should be **open-ended** (asking _how_ or _why_), not a yes/no question, so that it invites detailed investigation[\[5\]](https://www.sjsu.edu/writingcenter/docs/handouts/Research%20Questions.pdf#:~:text=Finally%2C%20a%20research%20question%20should,%E2%80%9Cwhy%E2%80%9D%20in%20their%20research%20question)[\[10\]](https://www.scribbr.com/research-process/research-questions/#:~:text=Cannot%20be%20answered%20with%20yes,for%20robust%20investigation%20and%20discussion). It should target a gap or problem of interest (be _novel_ and _relevant_ to the field)[\[11\]](https://scientific-publishing.webshop.elsevier.com/research-process/finer-research-framework/#:~:text=3)[\[12\]](https://www.scribbr.com/research-process/research-questions/#:~:text=Relevant%20and%20original). Finally, ensure the question is **ethical** and **manageable**: it should respect any required ethical standards and be feasible in scope[\[13\]](https://scientific-publishing.webshop.elsevier.com/research-process/finer-research-framework/#:~:text=4)[\[14\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30686882/#:~:text=expressed%20by%20acronym%20,After%20narrowing%20the%20focus).

*   **Focused/Specific:** Centers on one issue. Avoid broad or ambiguous terms (e.g. change “environment” to a specific context)[\[6\]](https://www.sjsu.edu/writingcenter/docs/handouts/Research%20Questions.pdf#:~:text=Example%20Unclear%20Research%20Question%3A%20How,a%20researchable%20topic%20within%20the)[\[7\]](https://www.scribbr.com/research-process/research-questions/#:~:text=All%20research%20questions%20should%20be%3A).
*   **Feasible/Researchable:** Possible to answer with the time, money, data, and methods you have. If not, narrow it further[\[7\]](https://www.scribbr.com/research-process/research-questions/#:~:text=All%20research%20questions%20should%20be%3A)[\[9\]](https://www.scribbr.com/research-process/research-questions/#:~:text=Feasible%20and%20specific).
*   **Open-ended/Complex:** Uses “how” or “why” and allows detailed analysis. Closed yes/no questions are too limited[\[5\]](https://www.sjsu.edu/writingcenter/docs/handouts/Research%20Questions.pdf#:~:text=Finally%2C%20a%20research%20question%20should,%E2%80%9Cwhy%E2%80%9D%20in%20their%20research%20question)[\[10\]](https://www.scribbr.com/research-process/research-questions/#:~:text=Cannot%20be%20answered%20with%20yes,for%20robust%20investigation%20and%20discussion).
*   **Novel/Rele­vant:** Addresses an original or understudied angle. It should fill a gap or contribute to current debates in the field[\[11\]](https://scientific-publishing.webshop.elsevier.com/research-process/finer-research-framework/#:~:text=3)[\[12\]](https://www.scribbr.com/research-process/research-questions/#:~:text=Relevant%20and%20original).
*   **Ethical/Manageable:** In studies involving people or sensitive issues, ensure the question can be answered without ethical conflicts. Also check it’s manageable in size and design[\[13\]](https://scientific-publishing.webshop.elsevier.com/research-process/finer-research-framework/#:~:text=4)[\[14\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30686882/#:~:text=expressed%20by%20acronym%20,After%20narrowing%20the%20focus).

These qualities align with guidelines like those shown above: the scribbr.com summary (illustrated) lists _Focused, Researchable, Specific, Feasible, Original, Relevant,_ and _Complex_[\[7\]](https://www.scribbr.com/research-process/research-questions/#:~:text=All%20research%20questions%20should%20be%3A) as hallmarks of a strong question, echoing research advice.

## Frameworks and Evaluation Tools

Many researchers use structured frameworks to build questions. In clinical or social science research, **PICO** (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) is common, ensuring you specify key components[\[15\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37838572/#:~:text=composing%20and%20evaluating%20rigorous%20research,Finally). Other variants (PEO, SPIDER, etc.) serve similar roles. Regardless of field, you can also **evaluate** your question with checklists. For example, the **FINER** criteria (Feasible, Interesting, Novel, Ethical, Relevant) is a classic mnemonic to judge quality[\[16\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37838572/#:~:text=available%20to%20researchers%20and%20can,Finally). A useful extension is **FINERMAPS** (adding _Manageable, Appropriate, Potential value/publishability, Systematic_)[\[14\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30686882/#:~:text=expressed%20by%20acronym%20,After%20narrowing%20the%20focus). In practice, asking these questions can be a technique: _Is the study doable? Will people care about the answer? Is it ethically sound? Is the scope right?_ A question that passes the “FINERMAPS test” is likely to be well-posed[\[14\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30686882/#:~:text=expressed%20by%20acronym%20,After%20narrowing%20the%20focus).

In summary, use a combination of creative brainstorming and systematic checks. Start broad, use background research and tools (like concept maps) to narrow your topic[\[1\]](https://www.gvsu.edu/library/km/brainstorming-strategy-narrowing-a-topic-36.htm#:~:text=Brainstorming%20is%20the%20process%20by,down%20the%20topic%20is%20needed), then formulate an open question. Finally, refine it using criteria or feedback: ensure it is clear, focused, original, and feasible[\[16\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37838572/#:~:text=available%20to%20researchers%20and%20can,Finally)[\[14\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30686882/#:~:text=expressed%20by%20acronym%20,After%20narrowing%20the%20focus). This systematic approach will help you craft a strong research question suitable for rigorous investigation.
