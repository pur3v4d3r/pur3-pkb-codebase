> [!INFO] **Developing a comprehensive keyword list** is the initial step.
> The research question should be broken down into its core concepts. For each concept, the researcher must brainstorm an extensive list of synonyms, alternative phrases, and related terms. For example, a concept like "self-esteem" might also be expressed as "self-worth" or "self-perception". It is also crucial to consider variations in spelling (e.g., American behavior vs. British behaviour). Reviewing the keywords and subject headings of already-known relevant articles is an excellent way to expand this list.

With a list of keywords for each concept, the researcher then combines them using **Boolean operators**, the fundamental syntax of database searching:

*   > [!INFO] **AND** is used to _narrow_ a search by requiring that all terms appear in the results. It connects different concepts. For example, a search for adolescents AND depression AND exercise will only retrieve documents that contain all three concepts.
*   > [!INFO] **OR** is used to _broaden_ a search by retrieving results that contain any of the specified terms. It is essential for combining synonyms within a single concept. For example, exercise OR "physical activity" OR fitness will find documents that mention at least one of these related terms.
*   > [!INFO] **NOT** is used to _exclude_ results containing a specific term. For example, depression NOT bipolar would remove articles that mention bipolar disorder.
    > [!CAUTION] This operator must be used with extreme caution, as it can easily eliminate relevant articles that happen to mention the excluded term in a different context.

To further refine the search, researchers must use **search modifiers**:

*   > [!INFO] **Phrase Searching** using quotation marks (" ") ensures that words are searched as an exact phrase, which dramatically increases relevance. For example, searching for "social media" is far more precise than searching for social AND media.
*   > [!INFO] **Truncation**, often using an asterisk (\*), finds all variations of a word root. For example, therap\* will retrieve therapy, therapies, therapist, and therapeutic.
*   > [!INFO] **Wildcards**, often a question mark (?) or hash (#), substitute for a single character within a word. This is useful for capturing plural forms or spelling variations, such as wom?n to find both woman and women.
*   > [!INFO] **Parentheses** (( )) are used to group terms and control the order in which the database processes the Boolean operators. Terms inside parentheses are processed first. This is crucial for building complex search strings. For example, (adolescent OR teenager) AND (depression OR "mood disorder") correctly combines the synonyms for each concept before combining the two concepts.

> [!INFO] The most effective search strategies combine these free-text keyword techniques with the **controlled vocabulary** (or subject headings) specific to a database, such as MeSH in PubMed. Indexers assign these standardized terms to articles, allowing a researcher to find all articles about a concept, regardless of the specific terminology the original authors used.

Finally, a powerful complementary technique is **citation searching**. This involves:

*   > [!NOTE] **Backward Citation Searching:** Manually scanning the reference lists of highly relevant articles to identify older, foundational studies that the database search may have missed.
*   > [!NOTE] **Forward Citation Searching:** Using the features of databases like Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar to find newer articles that have cited a known key paper. This helps to trace the evolution of an idea and find the most current research.
