> [!INFO] Key Search Principle
> The first step in any search is to identify the most appropriate places to look. No single database covers the entirety of scholarly literature, making it critical to search across a range of resources to ensure comprehensiveness, particularly for systematic reviews.40 The choice of databases should be guided by the research topic.

**Major Multidisciplinary Databases** serve as the foundation for most searches due to their broad coverage:

> [!INFO] Scopus
> An extensive database from Elsevier, Scopus provides broad coverage across scientific, technical, medical, and social science fields. It is particularly valued for its comprehensive citation metrics (such as CiteScore and SJR) and its indexing of over 28,000 peer-reviewed journals, as well as conference proceedings and books.42

> [!INFO] Web of Science (WoS)
> Produced by Clarivate Analytics, Web of Science is renowned for its rigorous selection process, resulting in a curated collection of high-quality, high-impact journals. It offers deep historical coverage, with some records dating back to 1864, and provides key metrics like the Journal Impact Factor (JIF). Its "Core Collection" is a vital resource for citation tracking.42

> [!INFO] Google Scholar - Strengths
> A freely accessible search engine that indexes a vast and diverse range of scholarly literature, including articles, theses, books, abstracts, and court opinions, from academic publishers, professional societies, online repositories, and universities. Its strengths are its broad coverage and ease of use.
>
>> [!CAUTION] Google Scholar - Limitations
>> However, it lacks the strict quality criteria of curated databases, and its search results are ranked by a proprietary algorithm that prioritizes citation counts, which may not always align with relevance or quality.42

**Specialized Databases** are crucial for in-depth searches within a specific discipline:

> [!INFO] PubMed/MEDLINE
> As the premier database for the biomedical and life sciences, maintained by the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM), PubMed is an indispensable resource for health-related topics. Its most powerful feature is the use of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), a controlled vocabulary that allows for highly precise and systematic searching.42

> [!INFO] Other Discipline-Specific Databases
> Other discipline-specific databases include **PsycINFO** for psychology, **EconLit** for economics, **CINAHL** for nursing and allied health, and **Inspec** for physics and engineering.5

> [!TIP] Database Selection Tip
> Consulting a university librarian can help identify the most relevant databases for a given topic.50

> [!INFO] Grey Literature
> Grey Literature refers to research that is not published in traditional commercial channels. This includes theses, dissertations, conference proceedings, government reports, and clinical trial registries. Searching for grey literature is essential for minimizing publication bias—the tendency for studies with statistically significant or "positive" results to be more likely to be published than those with null or negative findings.19

To assist in selecting the appropriate search venues, the following table provides a comparative overview of the major academic databases.

**Table 4.1: Guide to Major Academic Databases**

| Database | Subject Coverage | Key Features | Strengths | Limitations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Scopus | Broad: Science, Technology, Medicine, Social Sciences, Arts & Humanities 43 | Citation tracking (forward/backward), author profiles, CiteScore & SJR metrics, indexes conference papers and books 42 | Very broad interdisciplinary coverage, strong citation analysis tools, good for tracking research impact 42 | Subscription-based access, citation coverage is most comprehensive from 1996 onwards 44 |
| Web of Science | Broad: Sciences, Social Sciences, Arts & Humanities 43 | Citation tracking (forward/backward), Journal Impact Factor (JIF), rigorous journal selection process 42 | High-quality, curated content, deep historical archive (to 1864), considered prestigious 42 | Subscription-based access, may have less coverage of non-English journals and emerging fields compared to others 44 |
| Google Scholar | Extremely broad, all disciplines 42 | Free access, citation tracking (forward), indexes diverse content types (articles, preprints, books, theses) 44 | Unmatched breadth of coverage, excellent for finding grey literature and tracking citations across various sources 42 | Lacks quality control, inconsistent metadata, search algorithm is not transparent, advanced search features are limited 42 |
| PubMed/MEDLINE | Medicine, Nursing, Dentistry, Veterinary Medicine, Health Care System, Preclinical Sciences 42 | Controlled vocabulary (MeSH), clinical queries filters, free public access 45 | Gold standard for biomedical research, powerful and precise searching with MeSH terms, excellent for finding clinical trials 42 | Focused on biomedical topics; limited coverage of other disciplines 42 |

> [!TLDR] Comprehensive Search Strategy
> This table provides a strategic framework for developing a search plan. A comprehensive search does not rely on a single tool but leverages the unique strengths of multiple databases. For instance, a health sciences review might start with a precise MeSH-based search in PubMed, expand this search in Scopus and Web of Science to ensure broader journal coverage and robust citation tracking, and finally use Google Scholar to identify relevant grey literature that might have been missed. This multi-pronged approach is a hallmark of a rigorous and systematic search strategy.
