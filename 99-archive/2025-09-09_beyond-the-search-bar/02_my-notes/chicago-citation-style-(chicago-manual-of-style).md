### Chicago Style (Chicago Manual of Style)

> [!INFO] Overview of Chicago Style
> **Chicago Style** is frequently used in history, arts, and some humanities. The Chicago Manual of Style actually provides two different citation systems[\[21\]](https://louisville.edu/writingcenter/for-students-1/common-writing-questions-1/my-professor-wants-me-to-cite-my-sources-using-mla-apa-chicago-but-i-don2019t-know-what-that-means#:~:text=,not%20required%3B%20subheadings%20not%20required):

*   **Notes and Bibliography (Chicago NB):** This system uses **footnotes or endnotes** for citations, along with a bibliography. In the text, you place a superscript number after the information that needs a source (for example, “According to one historian, the data was flawed.¹”). That number corresponds to a numbered note at the bottom of the page (footnote) or at the end of the paper (endnote) which provides the source details[\[21\]](https://louisville.edu/writingcenter/for-students-1/common-writing-questions-1/my-professor-wants-me-to-cite-my-sources-using-mla-apa-chicago-but-i-don2019t-know-what-that-means#:~:text=,not%20required%3B%20subheadings%20not%20required).
    > [!INFO] Example: Chicago NB Citation
    > For instance, a footnote might read: **1\. John Smith, _The Art of Research_ (New York: Research Press, 2020), 45.** The bibliography at the end then lists: **Smith, John. _The Art of Research_. New York: Research Press, 2020.**
    > [!NOTE] Advantages of Chicago NB
    > This style is very flexible and often allows additional commentary in the footnotes. It’s useful for writers who want to provide context or explain sources in detail without cluttering the main text.
*   **Author-Date (Chicago AD):** This system is more like APA, using in-text parenthetical citations containing the author’s name and year, plus a reference list at the end.
    > [!INFO] Example: Chicago AD Citation
    > For example, **(Smith 2020, 45)** in text, with a reference list entry “Smith, John. 2020. _The Art of Research_. New York: Research Press.” The author-date format is common in some social sciences that prefer Chicago’s overall style but need in-text citations for brevity.

> [!WARNING] Always Clarify
> If someone says “Chicago style,” you should clarify which of the two systems is required, though often **Chicago’s Notes and Bibliography** style is what’s meant for papers in history or literature.
> [!NOTE] Chicago NB is Common
> The Chicago NB format is known for its footnotes: readers see the source information at the bottom of each page, and a full bibliography provides an alphabetical list of all sources. This system can accommodate a wide range of source types and is excellent for detailed scholarly work with many sources.
> [!CAUTION] Consult the Manual
> Keep in mind that Chicago style has many detailed rules (for punctuation, abbreviations, etc.), so it’s a good idea to consult the _Chicago Manual of Style_ or a summary guide when using it.
