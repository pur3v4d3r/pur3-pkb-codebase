**Outline Method:**

> [!INFO] Definition
> This is a traditional and widely-used format for notes. The outline method organizes information in a **hierarchical, bullet-point structure**. Main ideas go on the left as headings, and sub-points are indented underneath, further indented for details.

This chronological hierarchy makes it easy to keep up with a lecture and later review the main points and supporting details[\[4\]](https://tilt.colostate.edu/note-taking-strategies/#:~:text=The%20Outline%20Method%20is%20the,as%20easy%20to%20review%20later).

> [!NOTE] Suitability
> It’s a flexible method suitable for many subjects, especially those with a clear structure or textbook-style presentation.

> [!SUCCESS] Pros
> *   Visually clean and organized
> *   Easy to turn into study questions

> [!WARNING] Cons
> *   Not ideal for very visual information (like diagrams)
> *   Can become unwieldy if a lecture jumps around topics[\[5\]](https://tilt.colostate.edu/note-taking-strategies/#:~:text=,Converts%20easily%20into%20study%20notes)

> [!TLDR] Recommendation
> The Outline method is a great default if you’re unsure what to use – it works well for most humanities, social sciences, and general note-taking needs (maybe less so for formula-heavy math/science)[\[6\]\[7\]](https://e-student.org/note-taking-methods/#:~:text=Best%20for%3A%C2%A0Most%20subjects%20except%20science,such%20as%20physics%20or%20math).

> [!INFO] Method
> The Outline Method is one of the most common and intuitive systems. It organizes information hierarchically, using indentation to signify relationships between main topics, sub-topics, and supporting details.46 Major points are placed furthest to the left, with each subsequent level of detail indented further to the right.47

> [!NOTE] Cognitive Analysis - Strengths
> This method's primary strength is that it forces the note-taker to actively analyze the logical structure of the information being presented, which is a powerful encoding activity.47 The resulting notes are well-organized and easy to review, as the hierarchical structure makes the relationships between concepts visually explicit.46

> [!CAUTION] Cognitive Analysis - Limitations
> However, its reliance on a clear structure makes it difficult to implement during a fast-paced or disorganized lecture, as it requires significant in-the-moment thought to maintain the organization.47 It is also poorly suited for subjects like mathematics or chemistry, where formulas and diagrams are central.47

> [!TLDR] Best For
> Well-structured lectures in disciplines like history, literature, and political science, where information is often presented in a clear, thematic, or chronological hierarchy.46
