# Glossary of Common Media Biases

Understanding media biases is crucial for critical consumption of news and information. Biases can subtly or overtly influence how stories are reported, perceived, and understood, shaping public opinion and potentially distorting reality. Recognizing these different forms of bias empowers individuals to evaluate information more objectively and seek out diverse perspectives.

## Bias by Omission

*   **Definition:** Intentionally leaving out facts, events, or perspectives that would challenge a particular narrative or viewpoint.
*   **Example:** A news report on an economic policy only mentioning its benefits, while ignoring well-documented negative consequences.

## Bias by Placement

*   **Definition:** The importance an editor assigns to a story, indicated by its position in a publication or broadcast. Prominent placement (e.g., front page, top of a newscast) suggests higher importance.
*   **Example:** Placing a story critical of a politician on page 10, while a less significant but positive story about them is on the front page.

## Bias by Selection of Sources

*   **Definition:** Favoring sources that support a specific viewpoint while downplaying or excluding opposing ones, or using vague, unqualified sources.
*   **Example:** A story on climate change exclusively quoting researchers who doubt human impact, or using phrases like "some experts believe" without naming them.

## Bias by Story Selection

*   **Definition:** A consistent pattern of choosing to highlight news stories that align with a particular agenda while ignoring stories that contradict it.
*   **Example:** A news outlet repeatedly covering crime stories in a specific neighborhood, creating an impression of widespread danger, while ignoring similar crime rates elsewhere or positive community developments.

## Confirmation Bias

*   **Definition:** The psychological tendency for individuals (both journalists and news consumers) to seek out, interpret, and remember information in a way that confirms their pre-existing beliefs.
*   **Example:** A journalist with strong political views unconsciously giving more weight to information that supports their preferred party, or a viewer only watching news channels that affirm their worldview.

## Corporate Bias

*   **Definition:** When news content is influenced or slanted to protect the financial interests or reputation of the media outlet's owners, parent company, or advertisers.
*   **Example:** A news channel owned by a large corporation downplaying negative stories about that corporation's business practices, or avoiding critical reporting on major advertisers.

## Framing Bias

*   **Definition:** The way a story is presented, including the specific language, images, and context used, to influence how an audience understands and interprets it.
*   **Example:**
    *   **Episodic Framing:** Focusing on a single, isolated incident (e.g., "A car accident caused by a distracted driver").
    *   **Thematic Framing:** Providing broader context and underlying issues (e.g., "The rising rates of distracted driving and policy efforts to combat it").
    *   Using terms like "tax relief" versus "tax cut," or "undocumented worker" versus "illegal alien."

## Gatekeeping Bias

*   **Definition:** The process by which editors, producers, and other media decision-makers choose which stories are deemed "newsworthy" and will be published or broadcast, and which will be excluded.
*   **Example:** A news editor deciding not to run a story about a local protest because they believe it's not significant enough, or that it might upset local businesses.

## Labeling Bias

*   **Definition:** Using emotionally charged or descriptive labels for individuals, groups, or policies that convey a positive or negative judgment, while leaving others unlabeled or using neutral terms.
*   **Example:** Referring to one group as "freedom fighters" while an opposing group is called "terrorists," or consistently calling certain commentators "experts" without justifying their authority, while others are simply "critics."

## Negativity Bias

*   **Definition:** The disproportionate reporting of negative events (e.g., crime, conflict, disaster) over positive or neutral ones, which can lead to a distorted public perception of reality, making the world seem more dangerous or pessimistic than it is.
*   **Example:** A local newscast consistently leading with stories about murders and accidents, even when positive community initiatives are also happening.

## Partisan Bias

*   **Definition:** A clear inclination or prejudice in favor of a particular political party, ideology, or candidate, reflected in the reporting.
*   **Example:** A news article consistently using language that praises one political party's actions while criticizing the opposition, or frequently featuring commentators from only one side of the political spectrum.

## Sensationalism

*   **Definition:** A type of bias that favors the dramatic, shocking, or extraordinary over the ordinary and routine. It often exaggerates the importance or frequency of rare events.
*   **Example:** News coverage dedicating extensive airtime to a rare animal attack, giving the impression that such events are common threats, while neglecting more pervasive but less exciting public health issues.
