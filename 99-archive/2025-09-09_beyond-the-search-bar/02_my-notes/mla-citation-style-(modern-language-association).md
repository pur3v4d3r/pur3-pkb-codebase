### MLA Style (Modern Language Association)

> [!INFO] **MLA Style** is commonly used in the humanities, such as literature, language studies, and philosophy.

> [!INFO] MLA uses an **author–page** format for in-text citations[\[19\]](https://louisville.edu/writingcenter/for-students-1/common-writing-questions-1/my-professor-wants-me-to-cite-my-sources-using-mla-apa-chicago-but-i-don2019t-know-what-that-means#:~:text=,completely%20in%20Works%20Cited%20list).
> This means the citation includes the author’s last name and the page number from which the information or quote is taken, but usually **not the year** of publication.

> [!EXAMPLE] For example, an MLA in-text citation might look like: **(Smith 45)**, indicating that the idea or quote came from page 45 of a work by Smith.

> [!NOTE] MLA’s focus on page numbers aligns with the humanities’ emphasis on close reading of texts and exact quotations[\[19\]](https://louisville.edu/writingcenter/for-students-1/common-writing-questions-1/my-professor-wants-me-to-cite-my-sources-using-mla-apa-chicago-but-i-don2019t-know-what-that-means#:~:text=,completely%20in%20Works%20Cited%20list).

> [!INFO] At the end of the paper, MLA style uses a **“Works Cited”** page to list full publication details of all sources cited in the text[\[7\]](https://gradcoach.com/reference-list-vs-bibliography/#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20%E2%80%9CWorks%20Cited%E2%80%9D,page).
> > [!NOTE] If you consulted sources that you did not cite, MLA might instruct you to include those in a separate “Works Consulted” list, but typically only cited works are listed in Works Cited.

In the Works Cited entries, author names are written in full (e.g., Smith, John), and titles of books or articles are capitalized headline-style. An example MLA works cited entry for a book:

> [!EXAMPLE]
> Smith, John. _The Art of Research_. Research Press, 2020.

> [!NOTE] Distinctive features of MLA format:
> *   Has the author’s full first name (unlike APA which uses initials)[\[20\]](https://louisville.edu/writingcenter/for-students-1/common-writing-questions-1/my-professor-wants-me-to-cite-my-sources-using-mla-apa-chicago-but-i-don2019t-know-what-that-means#:~:text=,cover%20page%20or%20abstract%20required).
> *   Puts the publication year at the end of the entry (not immediately after the author as APA does).
> *   Formatting of titles (books and journals in _italics_, articles in “quotes”) and punctuation.
> *   Generally does not require a separate title page for essays and has a specific format for things like line spacing and the header, but those are part of the style’s overall guidelines.

> [!TLDR] In terms of citations, remember **author-page in-text citations** and the Works Cited list for full details.
