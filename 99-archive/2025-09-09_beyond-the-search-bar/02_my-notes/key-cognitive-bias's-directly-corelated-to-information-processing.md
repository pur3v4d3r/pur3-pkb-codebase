Key cognitive biases that directly impact how we process information include:

*   **Anchoring Bias:**
    > [!INFO] Definition
    > The tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information received (the "anchor") when making decisions.
    > [!NOTE] Example
    > For example, the first price quoted for a car sets a mental anchor that influences perceptions of subsequent offers.9

*   **Availability Heuristic:**
    > [!INFO] Definition
    > Placing greater value and perceived likelihood on information that comes to mind easily.
    > [!NOTE] Example
    > A recent news report about a plane crash may cause someone to overestimate the danger of flying, as that event is more readily "available" in their memory than statistics on air travel safety.9

*   **Authority Bias:**
    > [!INFO] Definition
    > The tendency to attribute greater accuracy to the opinion of an authority figure, regardless of the content of that opinion or whether their authority is relevant to the topic at hand.11

*   **The Dunning-Kruger Effect:**
    > [!INFO] Definition
    > A bias in which individuals with low ability at a task overestimate their ability.
    > [!WARNING] Implication
    > This can lead people to believe they are more capable of spotting false information than they actually are, preventing them from recognizing their own incompetence in this area.9
