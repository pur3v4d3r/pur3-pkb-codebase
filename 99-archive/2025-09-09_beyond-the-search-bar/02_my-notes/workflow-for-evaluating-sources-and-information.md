# Verification Workflow

An effective verification workflow employs an adaptive, tiered approach to information scrutiny, applying escalating levels of analysis based on context and importance. This "cognitive budgeting" prevents burnout while ensuring high-stakes content receives thorough examination.

## A Tiered Approach: From Quick Scans to Deep Dives

### Tier 1: The 60-Second Scan (SIFT Method)
This is the default mode for everyday information (e.g., social media, news headlines), focused on rapid filtering.
- **Stop:** Note strong emotional reactions.
- **Investigate:** Quickly check if you recognize the source (publication/author).
- **Find:** See if the information is reported by multiple, more reliable sources.
- **Trace:** If content (quote, image, video) seems out of context, quickly check. Dismiss if it fails these checks.

### Tier 2: The 10-Minute Evaluation (Adding CRAAP)
For information considered for sharing, low-stakes citation, or opinion formation.
- **Perform a Tier 1 SIFT Scan:** If it passes, proceed.
- **Apply Key CRAAP Criteria:**
    - Is the information **Current** enough?
    - Is the author a genuine **Authority** on the specific claim?
    - What is the clear **Purpose** of the piece (inform vs. persuade)?

### Tier 3: The Deep Dive (Full Spectrum Analysis)
Reserved for critical tasks like academic research, professional reports, financial, or health decisions.
- **Systematic SIFT & CRAAP:** Conduct a thorough analysis.
- **Author Analysis:** Deep background check for financial and non-financial conflicts of interest.
- **Publisher Analysis:** Investigate funding, editorial board, peer-review standards, and reputable indexes (e.g., DOAJ, COPE).
- **Content Deconstruction:** Meticulously analyze for logical fallacies, emotionally charged language, statistical manipulation, and trace major claims to primary sources.

## Integrating Digital Tools: The Verifier's Arsenal

Digital tools significantly enhance efficiency and accuracy in the verification process.

-   **Fact-Checking Databases:** Leverage professional work by searching databases like Google's **Fact Check Explorer** for claims already debunked by reputable organizations.
-   **Reverse Image Search:** Identify original context, date, and location of images stripped of context or manipulated. Tools include **Google Images**, **TinEye**, and **Yandex**.
-   **Video & Media Verification:** For complex video analysis, tools like the **InVID/WeVerify Verification Plugin** can extract metadata, fragment videos into keyframes for reverse search, and offer forensic analysis.
-   **Archiving Services:** Combat ephemeral online information by using services like the **Internet Archive's Wayback Machine** and **Archive.today** to view older versions of web pages or access removed content, crucial for tracing story evolution.
