Visual and Associative Methods (The "Artist's" Toolkit)

> [!INFO] These non-linear methods prioritize connections and relationships over hierarchical structure, making them ideal for visual learners and for exploring complex, interconnected topics.

#### 3.2.1 The Mapping and Mind Mapping Methods

> [!INFO] **Method:** Mapping is a visual method that represents information graphically. A mind map typically starts with a central idea in the middle of the page, with main topics branching out radially. Sub-topics and details then branch off from these main branches, creating a web of interconnected ideas.63 A concept map is similar but can have multiple hubs and more complex, explicitly labeled relationships between concepts.5

> [!INFO] **Cognitive Analysis - Benefits:** This method maximizes active participation by requiring the user to constantly think about how ideas relate to one another.46 It provides an excellent "at-a-glance" overview of a topic, helping to see the bigger picture and the connections between disparate pieces of information.17 This visual and spatial encoding can be very powerful for memory.
> [!WARNING] **Cognitive Analysis - Challenges:** It can be difficult to execute neatly during a fast-paced lecture, and notes can become cluttered or run out of space on the page.48

> [!NOTE] **Best For:** Brainstorming sessions, consolidating and synthesizing notes from a reading, or visualizing complex systems where relationships are more important than a strict hierarchy.63

#### 3.2.2 The Boxing Method

> [!INFO] **Method:** The Boxing Method is a visually oriented technique where related notes are grouped together within boxes drawn on the page. Each box typically contains a single topic or sub-topic, allowing for a modular organization of information.48 This method is particularly well-suited to digital note-taking apps where boxes can be easily created, resized, and moved.

> [!INFO] **Cognitive Analysis - Benefits:** This method visually "chunks" information into thematic groups, which can aid in recall. The process of deciding what information belongs in a box and then physically (or digitally) enclosing it can reinforce the connections within that topic.48
> [!CAUTION] **Cognitive Analysis - Important Consideration:** Because it requires some prior understanding of how the ideas group together, it is often more effective as a revision or reorganization strategy than for live note-taking during a lecture.48

> [!NOTE] **Best For:** Revising and organizing notes after a lecture, especially on digital platforms. It creates a clean, dashboard-like overview of a subject that is easy to scan.17
