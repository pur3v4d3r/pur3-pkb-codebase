> [!INFO] The standard process for de-duplication involves using **reference management software**. The most common tools for this purpose are Zotero, Mendeley, and EndNote.61
The workflow is as follows:

1.  Export all search results from each database.
2.  Import the results into the chosen reference management software.
    > [!NOTE] A best practice is to import the results from each database into a separate folder or collection initially. This allows the researcher to record the exact number of hits from each source, which is required for the PRISMA flow diagram.63
3.  Once all results are imported and initial counts are recorded, merge the separate collections into a single master library.
4.  Use the software's built-in de-duplication feature to automatically identify and flag potential duplicates. These tools typically compare fields like title, author, year, and journal to find matches.60
5.  Manually review the flagged duplicates to confirm they are indeed the same record before deleting them.
    > [!CAUTION] Automated tools are not perfect and can sometimes miss duplicates with minor variations in their metadata or incorrectly flag different articles as duplicates.61
