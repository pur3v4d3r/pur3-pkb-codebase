| Section                             | Purpose                                                                                         | Key Questions to Address                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Common Pitfalls                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Title Page                       | To provide essential identifying information.                                                   | What is a concise yet descriptive title for the project? Who is the researcher? What is the institutional context?                                                                                                          | A title that is too vague, overly technical, or does not accurately reflect the project's scope.                                                                        |
| 2. Introduction                     | To establish the context, significance, and focus of the research.                              | What is the general topic? Why is this topic important now? What is the specific problem or issue? What are the primary research questions?                                                                                 | Failing to clearly define the research problem; not providing sufficient background for a non-expert reader; lacking a clear and focused research question.             |
| 3. Literature Review                | To situate the research within the existing scholarly conversation and justify its originality. | What is the current state of knowledge on this topic? What are the key theories, findings, and debates? What are the strengths and weaknesses of previous research? What is the specific "gap" that this project will fill? | Being purely descriptive instead of critical and analytical; failing to synthesize sources; not clearly connecting the literature to the proposed research question.    |
| 4. Aims & Objectives                | To state the specific, measurable outcomes of the project.                                      | What is the overall aim or goal of the research? What are the specific, concrete objectives that will be achieved? If applicable, what are the testable hypotheses?                                                         | Objectives that are too broad, vague, or unmeasurable; a mismatch between the objectives and the research question.                                                     |
| 5. Research Design & Methodology    | To detail and justify the practical steps of the research process.                              | What is the overall approach (qualitative/quantitative/mixed)? What specific design will be used (e.g., experiment, case study)? Who/what will be studied (population/sample)? How will data be collected and analyzed?     | Lack of justification for methodological choices; insufficient detail for the procedures to be replicated; misalignment between the methods and the research questions. |
| 6. Ethical Considerations           | To demonstrate awareness of and a plan for addressing ethical issues.                           | Does the research involve human or animal subjects? How will informed consent be obtained? How will privacy and confidentiality be protected? What are the potential risks and how will they be mitigated?                  | Overlooking potential ethical issues; providing a generic statement without specific procedures; failing to mention the need for institutional ethics approval.         |
| 7. Timeline & Budget                | To demonstrate the feasibility and practical planning of the project.                           | What are the major phases of the research? What are the key milestones and their deadlines? What resources (time, money, equipment) are required?                                                                           | An unrealistic or overly ambitious timeline; failure to account for potential delays; an incomplete or unjustified budget.                                              |
| 8. Expected Outcomes & Contribution | To articulate the potential impact and originality of the research.                             | What are the anticipated findings? How will this research contribute to academic knowledge? What are the potential practical or theoretical implications?                                                                   | Exaggerating the potential impact; restating the objectives without explaining the broader contribution to the field.                                                   |
| 9. References                       | To properly attribute all sources cited in the proposal.                                        | Have all sources been included? Is the list formatted correctly according to the required citation style?                                                                                                                   | Incomplete or incorrectly formatted reference list; citing sources not mentioned in the text.                                                                           |
|                                     |                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                         |
