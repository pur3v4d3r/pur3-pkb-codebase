## Types of Notes: From Fleeting Jots to Permanent Knowledge

Not all notes serve the same purpose. It’s helpful to recognize that there are **different types of notes** you might take, each with a role in your learning process. Modern note-taking approaches, especially influenced by the Zettelkasten or “Smart Notes” method, often distinguish note types by how and when they’re used:

*   **Fleeting Notes:**
    > [!INFO] These are quick, on-the-fly notes – essentially your **rough, temporary jottings**.
    > Fleeting notes capture thoughts _in the moment_ and aren’t meant to be polished or permanent[\[27\]](https://www.goodnotes.com/blog/zettelkasten-method#:~:text=1,learnings%20from%20what%20you%20read).
    For example, if you’re reading and an idea strikes (“check how this formula applies to project”), you jot it down so it’s not lost. Later, you’ll decide if it’s worth keeping or elaborating.
    > [!NOTE] Tip: Keep a small notebook or a note app handy for these, so you don’t lose any spontaneous insights.
    > [!CAUTION] But also schedule time to review and process them, since by design fleeting notes are incomplete.

*   **Literature (or Study) Notes:**
    > [!TLDR] When you are reading a source (textbook, article, research paper) or attending a lecture, you take literature notes. These **focus on the content of a source** – capturing the key points, arguments, evidence, and your own commentary on them[\[28\]](https://www.goodnotes.com/blog/zettelkasten-method#:~:text=2,a%20summarization%20of%20your%20ideas).
    For instance, after reading a chapter, you might write a summary or list the key facts you learned, along with page references.
    > [!INFO] Each literature note often corresponds to one source or one specific piece of material.
    > [!WARNING] _The key is to keep each note focused on a single idea or topic_ from that source, rather than copying entire pages.
    This might mean if a textbook chapter taught you three big concepts, you make three separate notes – one per concept.
    > [!NOTE] Literature notes are great for studying because they distill source material into a form you can review.
    > [!NOTE] If you use Zotero (discussed below), the notes you take on a PDF or book would fall in this category.
    > [!QUESTION] They answer: _“What did I learn from this source?”_

*   **Permanent Notes:**
    > [!TLDR] These are the notes that you keep and organize long-term – the distilled insights and knowledge that you want to remember indefinitely.
    > [!INFO] A permanent note is typically written _in your own words_ and contains an idea that stands on its own, even outside the context of the source it came from[\[29\]](https://www.goodnotes.com/blog/zettelkasten-method#:~:text=you%20read,you%20might%20not%20need%20to).
    > [!INFO] In the Zettelkasten system, you would take your literature notes and then **rewrite the important ideas as permanent notes**, each addressing a single concept, and link them to related notes.
    For example, after reading several sources on a topic like “Photosynthesis,” you might create a permanent note summarizing “Factors affecting photosynthesis” – combining insights from all those sources, written as a coherent piece of knowledge.
    > [!INFO] These notes are “permanent” because you intend to revisit and build on them over time.
    > [!NOTE] They often form the backbone of essays, projects, or your cumulative understanding of a subject. Think of them like individual wiki pages in your personal knowledge base.

*   **Reference or Index Notes:**
    > [!TLDR] These are notes that **help organize or connect other notes**.
    In a paper notebook this might be a table of contents or index you create. In a digital system, it could be an overview note that links out to a collection of related notes. For instance, you might have a note titled “Biology 101 Topics” that lists and links all your notes for that course. Or a note that serves as a glossary of key terms with definitions.
    > [!INFO] In Zettelkasten, some people create “hub” notes (also called structure notes) that gather links on a particular theme.
    > [!INFO] Reference notes don’t contain new content themselves; they point you to where information is.
    > [!NOTE] (In a purely physical Zettelkasten, one might need a reference card to indicate, say, the numbering system or related entries. Digital tools often make this easier with search and tags, so you may or may not explicitly create reference notes[\[30\]](https://www.goodnotes.com/blog/zettelkasten-method#:~:text=term,need%20to%20create%20reference%20notes).)

*   **Lecture/Class Notes vs. Review Notes:**
    Another way to classify notes is by when they’re made in the learning process.
    > [!INFO] **Class or lecture notes** are what you write during the initial learning (in class or while reading). **Review notes** (or study notes) are what you create later _from your original notes_ – for example, a condensed study guide, a set of flashcards, or a summary of the semester’s material.
    > [!NOTE] It’s often useful to transform raw class notes into cleaner review notes as a way of studying.
    This might involve rewriting messy bits, organizing topics more clearly, and highlighting gaps to fill in.
    > [!INFO] The act of making review notes is a form of studying in itself (akin to teaching the material to yourself in a simplified form).

Recognizing these types can help you refine your workflow. You might start with messy **fleeting notes** in class, then turn those into organized **lecture notes** or **literature notes** soon after. Later, you distill the most important points into **permanent notes** or a **summary**. By doing so, you move from raw information to digested knowledge. If using a system like Zettelkasten (possibly with Obsidian), you’ll mostly be dealing with literature notes and permanent notes in your vault, while fleeting notes might live in a daily journal or scratchpad until processed.

> [!TLDR] The takeaway: not everything you write down needs to be kept forever. Separate the **temporary** from the **lasting**. This prevents your archive from being cluttered with redundant or low-value notes and ensures the notes you do keep are meaningful and usable long-term.
