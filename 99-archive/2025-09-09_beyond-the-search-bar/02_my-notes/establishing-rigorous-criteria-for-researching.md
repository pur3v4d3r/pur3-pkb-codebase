> [!INFO] Defining Eligibility Criteria
> Once a focused research question is established, the next step is to define the **eligibility criteria**—a set of pre-specified rules that determine which studies will be included in or excluded from the review.35 This is a standard and required practice for any high-quality, reproducible research, as it is a primary defense against selection bias.36

These criteria are not arbitrary; they logically follow from the research question and are often directly based on the PICO components.14 They are divided into two categories:

> [!INFO] Inclusion Criteria
> **Inclusion Criteria** are the characteristics that a study _must possess_ to be considered for the review.37 These criteria define the key features of the target literature. Typical inclusion criteria specify:
> *   **Population characteristics:** Age, gender, specific disease or condition.
> *   **Intervention characteristics:** Type of intervention, dosage, duration.
> *   **Study characteristics:** Publication date range, language, geographical location.
> *   **Methodological characteristics:** Specific study designs, such as including only randomized controlled trials (RCTs).14

> [!INFO] Exclusion Criteria
> **Exclusion Criteria** are characteristics that will disqualify a study, even if it meets all the inclusion criteria.37 The purpose of exclusion criteria is to remove studies that may have confounding factors or practical issues that could compromise the review's validity. Common exclusion criteria include:
> *   The presence of comorbidities or co-interventions that could interfere with the results.
> *   Studies with incomplete or ambiguously reported methods.
> *   Practical considerations, such as the inability to obtain the full-text article.
> *   Studies that fail to meet a pre-determined threshold for methodological quality.35

> [!CAUTION] Common Error in Exclusion Criteria
> A common error in defining exclusion criteria is to simply state the opposite of an inclusion criterion (e.g., if the inclusion criterion is "studies on adults," the exclusion criterion should not be "studies on children," as this is redundant). Instead, exclusion criteria should address specific factors that could introduce bias or noise into the analysis.37

> [!INFO] Mitigating Bias with Protocols
> The emphasis on developing a protocol—defining the research question and eligibility criteria _before_ beginning the search—is not merely about good organization. It is a fundamental scientific control designed to mitigate powerful cognitive biases that can undermine the integrity of the review. Systematic reviews are explicitly designed to "minimise bias" 12, and a primary source of bias is "cherry-picking"—the conscious or unconscious selection of studies that support a researcher's preconceived notions.19

> [!NOTE] The Power of *A Priori* Protocols
> To counter this, the methodology for rigorous reviews demands that the question and criteria be established _a priori_ (in advance) and documented in a formal protocol.14 This pre-commitment acts as a binding contract for the researcher. It prevents them from changing the rules of the review once they begin to see the data. For example, without a protocol, a researcher might be tempted to exclude a high-quality study that produced negative or inconvenient findings by retroactively deciding its methodology was "flawed" or its population was "not quite right." An _a priori_ protocol makes this type of post-hoc rationalization transparent and difficult to justify.

> [!TLDR] Protocol's Fundamental Role
> Therefore, the protocol is not just a plan; it is the primary methodological tool for ensuring the objectivity, transparency, and trustworthiness of the review's findings. It transforms the review from a subjective exploration into a replicable scientific investigation.
