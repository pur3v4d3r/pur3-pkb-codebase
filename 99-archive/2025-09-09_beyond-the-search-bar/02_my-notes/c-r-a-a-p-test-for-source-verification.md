# The CRAAP Test

The CRAAP Test is a widely recognized checklist for performing a detailed analysis of a source's content. Developed by librarians at California State University, Chico, it is designed for a "vertical" deep dive into a source. It is most effectively used as a secondary tool, after a source has already passed an initial credibility screening with methods like SIFT.

## Components of the CRAAP Test

The acronym CRAAP stands for five key criteria used to evaluate information sources:

### C - Currency

**Concept:** The timeliness of the information.

**Guiding Questions:**
- When was the information published or last updated?
- Does your topic require current information, or will older sources suffice?

### R - Relevance

**Concept:** The importance of the information for your specific needs.

**Guiding Questions:**
- Does the information directly relate to your topic or answer your question?
- Who is the intended audience?
- Is the information at an appropriate level for your needs?

### A - Authority

**Concept:** The source of the information.

**Guiding Questions:**
- Who is the author, publisher, or sponsor?
- What are their credentials or organizational affiliations?
- Are they qualified to write on this topic?

### A - Accuracy

**Concept:** The reliability, truthfulness, and correctness of the content.

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is the information supported by evidence?
- Has it been peer-reviewed?
- Can you verify the information in another source?
- Are there spelling or grammatical errors?

### P - Purpose

**Concept:** The reason the information exists.

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is the purpose to inform, teach, sell, entertain, or persuade?
- Do the authors make their intentions clear?
- Is the information fact, opinion, or propaganda?
- Does the point of view appear objective?

| Dimension          | SIFT Method                                                                                     | CRAAP Test                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Primary Strategy   | Lateral Reading (Investigating the source externally)                                           | Vertical Analysis (Evaluating the source's internal content)                                                                      |
| Core Question      | "Is this source credible and worth my time?"                                                    | "Is this specific content accurate and appropriate for my need?"                                                                  |
| Best Use Case      | Rapid evaluation of unfamiliar online sources, social media posts, and breaking news.           | In-depth analysis of a pre-vetted source for an academic paper, professional report, or important decision.                       |
| Key Strength       | Speed and efficiency; highly effective at identifying unreliable and deceptive sources quickly. | Thoroughness and structure; provides a detailed framework for content analysis.                                                   |
| Potential Weakness | May not provide enough detail for deep content analysis required for academic work.             | Impractical and inefficient for the high volume of information encountered daily; can be fooled by sophisticated deceptive sites. |
