### The SQ3R Method (Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Review)**

The SQ3R method is a time-tested framework particularly suited for dense academic texts or technical materials where comprehensive understanding is crucial. Think of it as a structured protocol that ensures no important element gets overlooked.

**Survey (5-10 minutes):** Begin with the reconnaissance mission I described earlier. Scan the entire chapter or article to understand its architecture. Read the introduction and conclusion fully. Note all headings, subheadings, and any emphasized text. Look at all visual aids. This creates your mental map.

**Question (3-5 minutes):** Transform every heading into a question. "The Doppler Effect" becomes "What is the Doppler effect? How does it work? Why is it important? How can I observe it?" Write these questions in your notebook. They become your learning objectives - concrete targets your reading must hit.

**Read (Active reading time):** Now read with purpose. You're not just reading - you're hunting for answers to your questions. Annotate as you go. When you find an answer, note which question it addresses. When new questions arise, add them to your list. Read at a pace that allows comprehension, not speed. <mark style="background: #B7FF00;">Stop after each section to ensure you understand before moving forward.</mark>

**Recite (10-15 minutes per section):** After each major section, stop and recite the answers to your questions without looking at the text. Explain the concepts aloud or in writing. This is where the learning crystallizes. If you can't recite clearly, you haven't learned deeply enough - return to the text with focused attention on the gaps.

**Review (15-20 minutes at end, then periodically):** Once you've completed the text, review all your questions and answers. Create a summary that synthesizes the main arguments. Schedule follow-up reviews - reviewing after 24 hours, then a week, then a month creates the spacing effect that moves information into long-term memory.

The SQ3R method might seem time-intensive, but it's actually efficient. By reading once with this level of engagement, you often understand and retain more than you would from multiple passive readings.
