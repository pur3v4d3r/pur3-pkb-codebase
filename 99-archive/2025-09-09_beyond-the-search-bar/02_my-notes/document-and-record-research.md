> [!INFO] Documenting the Search: Ensuring Transparency and Reproducibility
> The process of developing and running a search strategy is not merely a preliminary step but a core part of the review's methodology. As such, it must be treated with the same rigor as a scientific experiment.

> [!INFO] Science values reproducibility; an experiment conducted in a laboratory must be described with enough detail that another scientist can replicate it and, ideally, obtain the same results.

> [!INFO] The same principle applies to a literature search. The search strategy must be documented in enough detail to be "reproduced" or "replicated" by others.40

> [!NOTE] The components of the search—the choice of databases (the materials), the keywords and Boolean logic (the procedure), the filters and limits applied (the experimental conditions), and the number of results retrieved (the raw data)—are directly analogous to the components of a formal scientific experiment. The iterative process of testing and refining the search strategy by running it and checking if it retrieves known key papers is equivalent to piloting an experimental protocol.40

> [!IMPORTANT] Therefore, for a rigorous review, especially a systematic one, the search process must be meticulously documented to ensure transparency.50

> [!INFO] For each database searched, the researcher must record:
> *   The name of the database and the platform used (e.g., Ovid MEDLINE).
> *   The date the search was conducted.
> *   The complete, exact search string used for each query, copied and pasted to avoid errors.
> *   Any filters or limits that were applied (e.g., publication dates, language, study types).
> *   The total number of records retrieved from that search.33

> [!NOTE] This detailed documentation is not just for personal record-keeping.

> [!INFO] The full search strategies are typically included in the methods section or, more commonly, as an appendix in the final published review.50

> [!INFO] This practice allows for peer review of the search methodology itself and enables future researchers to replicate or update the review.

> [!TLDR] It transforms the search from a casual act of "looking for papers" into a formal, replicable, and scientifically defensible experiment in information retrieval.
