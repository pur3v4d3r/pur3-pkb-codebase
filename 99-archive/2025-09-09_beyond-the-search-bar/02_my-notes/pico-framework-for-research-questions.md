> [!INFO] PICO Framework Purpose
> The **PICO framework** is a highly effective and widely used tool, particularly for structuring questions for systematic reviews in the health sciences and other fields focused on interventions.

> [!INFO] PICO Acronym Breakdown
> The acronym stands for:
> *   **P – Population, Patient, or Problem:** Who are the specific subjects or what is the problem being addressed?
> *   **I – Intervention:** What is the main intervention, treatment, or exposure being considered?
> *   **C – Comparison or Control:** What is the main alternative to the intervention (e.g., a placebo, standard care, or another intervention)?
> *   **O – Outcome:** What is the effect, result, or consequence being measured?

> [!NOTE] PICOT Variation
> Some variations, like PICOT, add a T for Time frame to specify the duration of the intervention or follow-up.

> [!INFO] Benefit of PICO
> Using the PICO framework forces the researcher to articulate the key concepts of their question with a high degree of specificity, which directly informs the development of the search strategy and eligibility criteria.
