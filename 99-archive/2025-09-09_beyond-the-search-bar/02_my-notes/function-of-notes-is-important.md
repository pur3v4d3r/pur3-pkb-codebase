## Summary

> [!TLDR]
> This passage is basically stating that there are effectively two main functions of any given note: encoding and storage.

> [!INFO]
> Encoding seems to be the far more important of the two.

> [!NOTE]
> Encoding is where you listen or read the information given and decipher what it exactly means. The best practice is to actively participate with your notes, including summarizing and writing in YOUR OWN WORDS what it is that you are learning.

> [!INFO]
> By doing this, you're actively participating in a learning process. This makes you more likely to be able to recall key information, in essence, learning the material.

### 1.1 The Dual Functions of Note-Taking: Encoding and External Storage

Cognitive science identifies two primary functions of note-taking: the **encoding function** and the **storage function**.1 The storage function is the more obvious of the two; it involves creating an external memory aid—a set of notes on paper or a digital file—that can be reviewed at a later time. This function allows individuals to outsource their memory, documenting information that is too dense or complex to hold in the mind at once.3

However, the more critical and often overlooked function is **encoding**. Encoding refers to the set of mental processes that occur _during_ the act of taking notes. As a learner listens to a lecture or reads a text, they must comprehend the information, identify what is important, and then translate those concepts into their own words or structure.1 This act of processing, generating, and semantically organizing information strengthens the internal connections between ideas and facilitates deeper learning, even before the notes are ever reviewed.3 The most successful note-takers intuitively leverage this encoding function, understanding that the primary benefit of the activity is the thinking it requires in the moment. Ineffective note-takers, by contrast, focus almost exclusively on the storage function, acting as stenographers who capture words without processing their meaning, thereby missing the most potent learning opportunity.
