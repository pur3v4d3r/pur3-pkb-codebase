# Random Thoughts:
- Always re write what you've read into your own words and act as if your teaching a younger person. Simplify everything down to is most basic and simplest word.
	- This makes it so you can actually recall the information in the future.
- Also remember to do periodic reviews of information you've recently learned. It strengthens the bonds between thoughts.
- During reading <mark style="background: #B7FF00;">ALWAYS</mark> ask yourself questions, its important to actively engage with the work don't just passively read we wont learn as much of the material as wanting to.
- <mark style="background: #B7FF00;">KEEP THIS IN MIND</mark> it seems you need to start actively participating in reading before you actually will start really learning. Meaning just start. But you actually have to remember to start.
- This is going to be my legend for Highlighting:
	- <mark style="background: #B7FF00;">This is the color for something that I actively want to learn or remember.</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #FF8400;">This is the color for something that is in support of the evidence or material being read..</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #FF00CE;">This is the color for something that is an important thing being said by someone.</mark>(Think Reference or Quote)
	- <mark style="background: #FF0043;">This is the color for something that I don't understand, and need to look up more information on.
</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">This is the color for an Idea that Links to something else inside the vault.</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #00FFC9A6;">This is the Color for definition or terms and Equations Etc.</mark>
- Create a section (Folder) in the Vault for "Bridge Notes." These are notes that you try and connect the dots between two different ideas or thoughts. Bridge Notes. This bridging of the gap creates interconnected framework for all of your knowledge. These connections in turn produce there own in sights and thoughts/Ideas. A note that bears many connection is a positive assets in your Vault, these connection multiply over time (as long as you are consistent with your workflow) and grow into a network of interconnected thought much the same way the human brain works. Which is why connecting notes is so important, it fosters future knowledge growth, its a way to give your future self a boost in knowledge.
	- When you take two different concept and combine them your not just creating a new thought but new information that can potentially be contributed to the greater knowledge of mankind.
- Make sure to pause and take a short break in between sections, to give yourself a chance to process all the information you've just read. Try and summarize the finding of that previous section (IN YOUR OWN WORDS) in a short paragraph or so. When you find you cant finish a sentence or thought because of missing or incomplete information, that is your cue to go back and aggressively search for the answers to that gap in knowledge. After successfully finding and reading the information, go back to your summary and try to complete it. If you find another gap stop, and repeat the process from before. Continue this until the summary is complete. You should also be doing a longer version of this when you finish the paper or document.
- Claude says to start small and simply try ONE technique covered, then Claude suggested the Feynman technique where you over simplify the concept and try to tech it to a young adult with reasoning skills.
- Knowledge acquisition through reading seems is a three stage process. In which stage 1 is the warm-up where you are actively searching the document for information almost like an investigation, this is where you are constructing a framework for all the information to land.. Stage 2 happens during the actual reading of the material itself, where by actively engaging with the material you form the strong bonds of knowledge. Stage 3 is the continued pursuit were you spend the time required to re visit the information at a later date further cementing the strong connections formed during reading.
- <mark style="background: #B7FF00;">Try to implement turning heading and sub heading into questions on your next article.</mark>
- In actively reading your not just learning new information but your bringing your reality to the table, your essential creating new works or thoughts on the subject based on your own past experiences and perceived reality.
- In the article by Gemini-Deep-Research, Highlighting tricky you can trick yourself into thinking you've learned something just by highlighting it. You must actively participate during reading to completely understand the material.
- Get in the habit of before reading something ask yourself <mark style="background: #B7FF00;">Why am I reading?</mark>
- Always ask yourself open ended questions. This promotes the brain into Inquiry mode where its actively searching for the answer ,witch encourages thoughts and reflection.
- Short walks can stimulate critical thinking.
- <mark style="background: #B7FF00;">This is something I want to try</mark>: Every night before bedtime create a list of 3-5 task you want to accomplish the next day. What this does is gives you purpose first thing when you wake up, so you can immediately get to work on things that actually matter instead of wasting time with busy work.
	- Something to potentially add to this is to list out the things or tasks that went well for you that day, and what didn't work. This is so you can see what works and and doesn't work and can proactively make the necessary changes to your tasks.








# List of Things I want to Do:


1. *Quick pre-read ritual (2 minutes):* <mark style="background: #B7FF00;">Write your purpose, outline three questions, and predict the author’s thesis in one sentence.</mark>
2. Ask question at the beginning of each section and at the beginning of the document.
3. Practice Linking and have better understanding of the whole process
