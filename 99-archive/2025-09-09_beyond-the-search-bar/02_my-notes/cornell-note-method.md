**Cornell Method**

> [!TLDR] Overview
> The Cornell Note-Taking System is a **structured page layout** that encourages active engagement with the material. This system was invented by Prof. Walter Pauk in the 1950s and remains popular because it forces you to **interact with your notes twice** – once while taking them, and again when you summarize and devise cues[\[8\]](https://tilt.colostate.edu/note-taking-strategies/#:~:text=If%20the%20Outline%20Method%20is,you%20digest%20information%20more%20effectively)[\[9\]](https://tilt.colostate.edu/note-taking-strategies/#:~:text=Put%20the%20subject%20title%20at,you%20know%2C%20the%20%E2%80%9Cbig%20stuff). The active recall and review built into Cornell notes are great for retention.

> [!INFO] Structure
> A Cornell page is divided into three sections:
> - A narrow left column for _cues_ or keywords.
> - A wide right column for _notes_.
> - A summary box at the bottom.

> [!NOTE] How to Use
> During a lecture or reading, you take detailed notes in the right column (record facts, ideas, examples), while leaving the left margin empty or jotting key terms and questions there. After the session, you fill in the left **cue column** with questions, keywords, or prompts based on the notes (for example, “What is photosynthesis?” or “Key causes of WWII”), and write a 2-4 sentence **summary** at the bottom of the page.

> [!SUCCESS] Pros
> - Encourages understanding and summarization.
> - Easy to scan later by looking at cue words[\[10\]](https://tilt.colostate.edu/note-taking-strategies/#:~:text=).

> [!WARNING] Cons
> - Takes a bit more effort (you must set up the page and do the summary after class)[\[11\]](https://tilt.colostate.edu/note-taking-strategies/#:~:text=,to%20summarize%20after%20the%20lecture).

> [!EXAMPLE] Use Cases
> Cornell is versatile – it can be used for almost any subject and is especially helpful if your current notes feel disorganized. It shines in classes with lots of content or discussion. In fact, Cornell notes have been found useful for sciences, humanities, and _especially math_, where the format gives space to work through problems and note formulas[\[12\]](https://tilt.colostate.edu/note-taking-strategies/#:~:text=This%20method%20is%20much%20like,sciences%2C%20hummanities%2C%20and%20especially%20math).

> [!QUOTE] Student Testimonial
> Many students report significant benefits: one student found that after switching to Cornell, her notes became _“clear, organized, and super useful to study from,”_ which led to better grades[\[13\]](https://ectutoring.com/cornell-notes-increase-grades#:~:text=The%20impact%20was%20almost%20immediate,9%20in%20my%20sophomore%20year).

# The Cornell Method

> [!INFO] Method Overview
> Developed by Prof. Walter Pauk of Cornell University, this system divides a page into three distinct sections: a large main note-taking area on the right (approx. 70% of the page), a narrower cue column on the left, and a summary section at the bottom.46 During a lecture, notes are taken in the main column. As soon as possible after the lecture, the note-taker reviews their notes and synthesizes them into key questions, keywords, or "cues" in the left column. Finally, a one- or two-sentence summary of the page's content is written in the bottom section.32

> [!NOTE] Cognitive Analysis
> The Cornell Method is arguably one of the most cognitively robust systems because it explicitly builds in the principles of effective learning. The post-lecture steps of creating cues and summaries force the user to engage in active processing, summarization, and reflection, which are powerful encoding activities.31
> > [!IMPORTANT] Active Recall Focus
> > Crucially, the cue column is designed specifically for active recall; during review, the note-taker covers the main notes and attempts to answer the questions or explain the concepts prompted by the cues.32 This makes it a complete learning cycle in a single format.

> [!TIP] Best For
> Virtually any lecture-based course. Its combination of structure, active processing, and built-in self-testing makes it a powerful and versatile default system for any serious student.46
