### APA Style (American Psychological Association)

> [!INFO] **Definition & Usage**
> **APA Style** is widely used in the social sciences (psychology, education, sociology, etc.) and other fields.

> [!INFO] **Author–Date System for In-text Citations**
> APA format uses an **author–date** system for in-text citations[\[15\]](https://crossplag.com/citation-a-comprehensive-guide/#:~:text=APA%20style%20supports%20the%20author,1968)[\[16\]](https://louisville.edu/writingcenter/for-students-1/common-writing-questions-1/my-professor-wants-me-to-cite-my-sources-using-mla-apa-chicago-but-i-don2019t-know-what-that-means#:~:text=,research%20more%20important%20than%20researchers). This means that when you cite a source in the text, you include the author’s last name and the year of publication (and a page number if quoting directly).

> [!EXAMPLE] **In-text Citation Examples**
> For example, an APA in-text citation might look like: **(Smith, 2020)** for a general reference, or **(Smith, 2020, p. 45)** for a specific quote with page number.

> [!NOTE] **Emphasis on Recency**
> This emphasis on the year reflects the APA style’s focus on the recency of research (important in fields where information can become outdated)[\[16\]](https://louisville.edu/writingcenter/for-students-1/common-writing-questions-1/my-professor-wants-me-to-cite-my-sources-using-mla-apa-chicago-but-i-don2019t-know-what-that-means#:~:text=,research%20more%20important%20than%20researchers).

> [!INFO] **References Page**
> At the end of the document, APA style uses a **References** page (titled “References”) to list full details of each source cited[\[17\]](https://ohiostate.pressbooks.pub/choosingsources/chapter/steps-for-citing/#:~:text=Next%2C%20you%E2%80%99ll%20need%20a%20full,of%20them%20is%20very%20specific).

> [!NOTE] **Reference List Formatting Rules**
> In the reference list, entries are ordered alphabetically by author last name and include information like the publication year, title, and publisher or journal. APA has specific formatting rules – for instance, author names are written as Lastname, Initials (e.g., Smith, J. A.), and titles of books or articles are in sentence case (only the first word and proper nouns capitalized).

> [!EXAMPLE] **Reference for a Book**
> An example APA reference for a book might be:
> Smith, J. A. (2020). _The Art of Research._ New York: Research Press.

> [!NOTE] **Additional Paper Elements**
> APA style also often requires a title page and abstract in research papers (though these are formatting elements beyond just citations)[\[18\]](https://louisville.edu/writingcenter/for-students-1/common-writing-questions-1/my-professor-wants-me-to-cite-my-sources-using-mla-apa-chicago-but-i-don2019t-know-what-that-means#:~:text=American%20Psychological%20Association%20).

> [!TLDR] **Key Features of APA Citations**
> The key features to remember about APA citations are the use of **author-year in-text citations** and a corresponding reference list entry for each source. This style prioritizes the date of sources (to highlight up-to-date research) and typically discourages excessive direct quotations in favor of paraphrasing with proper attribution[\[16\]](https://louisville.edu/writingcenter/for-students-1/common-writing-questions-1/my-professor-wants-me-to-cite-my-sources-using-mla-apa-chicago-but-i-don2019t-know-what-that-means#:~:text=,research%20more%20important%20than%20researchers).
