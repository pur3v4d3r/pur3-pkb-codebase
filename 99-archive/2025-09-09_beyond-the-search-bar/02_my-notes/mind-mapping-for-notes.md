**Mind Mapping (Concept Maps):**
> [!TLDR] Mind maps are a **visual note-taking method** ideal for topics where understanding relationships is key.

Instead of linear text, you start with a central idea in the middle of the page and draw branches outward for subtopics, then further branches for details. The result looks like a web or tree of ideas.

> [!INFO] Key Characteristic
> This method taps into visual learning – by laying out information spatially, it can help in seeing the “big picture” and connections between concepts[[15]](https://tilt.colostate.edu/note-taking-strategies/#:~:text=Mind%20mapping%20is%20for%20the,when%20test%20time%20comes%20around).

> [!NOTE] Pros
> Great for brainstorming and showing how ideas interrelate; the visual nature can improve recall of complex information[[99-system/99-system's-reference/01_scratchpads/99_🦖pur3v4d3r's-📜scratchpads/scratchpad-16]](https://tilt.colostate.edu/note-taking-strategies/#:~:text=).

> [!CAUTION] Cons
> Mind maps can become messy or space-limited if there’s a lot of detail; also, it may be hard to do in a fast-moving lecture without practice[[99-system/99-system's-reference/01_scratchpads/99_🦖pur3v4d3r's-📜scratchpads/scratchpad-17]](https://tilt.colostate.edu/note-taking-strategies/#:~:text=).

> [!INFO] Use Cases
> Mind maps are especially useful in subjects like history, literature, psychology, or biology – where you might want to link events to causes, characters to themes, or parts of a system to one another[[18]](https://tilt.colostate.edu/note-taking-strategies/#:~:text=It%20is%20ideal%20for%20courses,making%C2%A0connections%20between%20ideas%20is%20crucial). They’re also excellent when preparing for essay writing (mapping out ideas and evidence) or whenever you need to organize information non-linearly.

> [!TIP] Making Mind Maps Effective
> To make a mind map effective, use keywords (not full sentences) in your bubbles, and feel free to add small sketches or icons – visual elements reinforce memory[[99-system/99-system's-reference/01_scratchpads/99_🦖pur3v4d3r's-📜scratchpads/scratchpad-19]](https://www.cultofpedagogy.com/note-taking/#:~:text=4,power%20of%20notes).
