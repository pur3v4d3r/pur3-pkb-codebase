**Plan and define your topic:**
> [!INFO] Start by clearly identifying what you need to research.
> [!CAUTION] If you have an assignment, ensure your topic fits the given guidelines[\[1\]](https://www.nhcc.edu/academics/library/doing-library-research/basic-steps-research-process#:~:text=1,information%2C%20you%20may%20need%20to).
> [!TIP] Choose a subject that interests you and has enough available information, but not so much that it overwhelms you[\[2\]](https://www.nhcc.edu/academics/library/doing-library-research/basic-steps-research-process#:~:text=about%20something%20that%20you%20find,by%20selecting%20an%20interesting%20and).
> [!TIP] It often helps to phrase your topic as a specific question you want to answer; for example, _“What are the causes of obesity in America?”_[\[3\]](https://www.nhcc.edu/academics/library/doing-library-research/basic-steps-research-process#:~:text=Once%20you%20have%20identified%20your,be%20used%20in%20your%20research).
This research question will guide your focus and help in finding relevant keywords.

**Break the process into steps:** A solid personal workflow will mirror the typical research process. One effective workflow includes these stages[\[4\]](https://www.nhcc.edu/academics/library/doing-library-research/basic-steps-research-process#:~:text=)[\[5\]](https://www.nhcc.edu/academics/library/doing-library-research/basic-steps-research-process#:~:text=,sources%20properly):

1.  > [!INFO] **Preliminary exploration:** Do a quick preliminary search to gauge how much information is available and to refine your topic if needed[\[6\]](https://www.nhcc.edu/academics/library/doing-library-research/basic-steps-research-process#:~:text=,a%20preliminary%20search%20for%20information). Skim encyclopedias or reliable reference sources for background context.
2.  > [!INFO] **Deep search for sources:** Use targeted search strategies (covered in the next section) to locate books, articles, and credible websites related to your topic[\[7\]](https://www.nhcc.edu/academics/library/doing-library-research/basic-steps-research-process#:~:text=)[\[8\]](https://www.nhcc.edu/academics/library/doing-library-research/basic-steps-research-process#:~:text=Use%20the%20library%27s%C2%A0electronic%20periodical%20databases%C2%A0to,text%20format).
3.  > [!INFO] **Source evaluation:** Critically evaluate each source’s credibility and relevance (more on this later). Weed out unreliable or tangential sources.
4.  > [!INFO] **Note-taking and organizing:** As you read your sources, take detailed notes and record citation details. Begin grouping ideas or evidence by theme.
5.  > [!INFO] **Synthesis and writing:** Organize your notes into an outline and start drafting your paper or report, integrating the information you gathered to support your points.
6.  > [!INFO] **Citing and proofreading:** Compile your bibliography and ensure all sources are properly cited. Finally, proofread your work for clarity, grammar, and proper source attribution[\[9\]](https://www.nhcc.edu/academics/library/doing-library-research/basic-steps-research-process#:~:text=,sources%20properly)[\[10\]](https://www.nhcc.edu/academics/library/doing-library-research/basic-steps-research-process#:~:text=).

**Be flexible and iterative:**
> [!INFO] Research is often an iterative (non-linear) process.
> [!NOTE] You might find yourself refining your research question or returning to search for additional sources as you learn more. This is normal – allow your workflow to loop back as needed.
> [!TIP] The key is to keep track of where you are in the process and adjust your plan.
> [!INFO] Documenting your search strategies (which search engines, databases, and keywords you used) can help you avoid going in circles and ensure reproducibility of your research[\[11\]](https://research.com/research/web-based-research-tips-for-conducting-academic-research#:~:text=When%20publishing%20your%20research%2C%20providing,methodology%20ensures%20reproducibility%20and%20accountability).

**Set goals and time management:**
> [!TIP] Design your workflow to fit your schedule and working style.
For example, you might dedicate one day to searching for sources, another to reading and note-taking, etc.
> [!TIP] Setting mini-deadlines for each step can keep you on track.
> [!NOTE] Developing a workflow that suits you will come with practice, but following a structured plan like the one above is a good starting point.
> [!TLDR] By breaking the project into clear steps, you ensure thorough coverage and reduce the chance of missing important information.
