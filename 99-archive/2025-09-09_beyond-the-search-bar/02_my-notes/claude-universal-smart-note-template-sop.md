## Step-by-step workflow for creating effective notes

**The CAPTURE-PROCESS-CONNECT-EVOLVE framework** provides a systematic approach to transforming information into knowledge through progressive note development.

### Phase 1: Initial Capture (2-5 minutes)
**Objective**: Preserve the spark of insight without losing momentum

1. **Quick brain dump** in daily note or quick capture system
2. **Tag with #pkb** status for later processing  
3. **Note source and context** while memory is fresh
4. **Capture personal reaction** - why this resonated or seemed important
5. **Continue with primary work** - don't break flow for perfect formatting

**Tools**: Voice memos, quick text capture, daily note template, mobile apps

### Phase 2: Structure and Refactor (10-15 minutes)
**Objective**: Transform raw capture into structured atomic note

1. **Create dedicated note** with proper template and metadata
2. **Write concept in your own words** - critical for understanding
3. **Identify the single atomic idea** - split if multiple concepts present
4. **Add descriptive title** that enables future recognition
5. **Structure with clear hierarchy** using headers and formatting
6. **Update status to #status/seedling** to indicate development progress

**Quality check**: Can someone else understand this concept from your explanation alone?

### Phase 3: Synthesis and Summarization (5-10 minutes)  
**Objective**: Distill essence and clarify significance

1. **Write one-sentence summary** capturing core insight
2. **Identify key supporting evidence** and examples  
3. **Note limitations and counterarguments** for balanced perspective
4. **Articulate why this matters** - personal significance and broader implications
5. **Generate extension questions** for future exploration
6. **Update status to #status/seedling** indicating need for connections

**Focus**: Compression and clarity over comprehensiveness

### Phase 4: Contextual Linking (5-15 minutes)
**Objective**: Integrate into existing knowledge network

1. **Search for related existing notes** using tags and content search
2. **Create explicit connections** with context explanations  
3. **Update related notes** with bidirectional links where appropriate
4. **Add to relevant Maps of Content (MOCs)** or index notes
5. **Link to active projects** where concept applies
6. **Update status to #permanent-note** when well-connected and mature

**Connection types**: Supporting evidence, contrasting views, building blocks, applications, historical development

### Phase 5: Review and Evolution (Weekly/Monthly)
**Objective**: Maintain and develop knowledge over time

1. **Weekly review**: Process #pkb and #status/seedling notes  
2. **Monthly review**: Strengthen connections in #status/seedling notes
3. **Quarterly review**: Update #permanent-note notes with new insights
4. **Annual review**: Archive outdated content and update core concepts

**Maintenance priorities**: Quality over quantity, strong connections over perfect organization

### Workflow Optimization Strategies

**Daily rhythm integration**: 
- Morning: Review yesterday's captures during coffee
- Throughout day: Quick capture in daily notes  
- Evening: Process 2-3 captured items before shutdown
- Weekly: Dedicated 30-minute review and connection session

**Batch processing techniques**:
- Group similar content types for efficient processing
- Use templates for consistent structure  
- Set processing quotas to prevent overwhelm
- Focus on recent captures while memory remains fresh

**Quality indicators**:
- Can find any note within 30 seconds
- Each atomic note connects to 3-5 other notes
- Regular creation of outputs from knowledge base
- Surprising connections emerge during review sessions
