**Charting Method:**
> [!INFO] Definition
> The Charting method formats your notes into a **table or spreadsheet-like grid**. You determine several categories or columns, and as you encounter information, you slot it into the appropriate column/row.

> [!NOTE] Examples
> For example, a history class might use columns like “Year,” “Event/Key figure,” “Significance,” “Notes/Details.” Or a biology note might chart different species or processes side by side.

> [!TLDR] Key Strength
> This method is superb for content that involves **comparisons, categories, or timelines** – it lets you see information in a structured, side-by-side format.

> [!NOTE] Pros
> Highly organized; reduces redundant writing by grouping info; ideal for memorizing facts or comparing features.

> [!WARNING] Cons
> Not well-suited to free-form lectures – it works best when you know the structure of information in advance, or for reorganizing notes after class. It can also be tricky during class discussion unless you keep it flexible.

> [!INFO] Use Cases
> Use charting for subjects with **structured data**: history (dates/events comparison), chemistry (e.g. properties of elements or compounds), anatomy (different organ systems), or any topic where you’re dealing with **multiple items that share attributes** (for instance, a chart of economic systems or philosophical doctrines and their principles). If an instructor provides a clear outline or if you’re reading a chapter with distinct sections, you can prepare a blank chart beforehand and fill it in as you go.

The Charting Method

> [!INFO] Method
> The Charting Method, also known as the matrix method, involves organizing notes into a table. The page is divided into columns, each with a heading for a specific category. Information is then recorded in the appropriate cells as the lecture progresses.46

> [!INFO] Cognitive Analysis
> This method is exceptionally powerful for subjects that require comparative analysis. The act of creating and filling the chart forces the user to actively categorize information, a strong encoding process that clarifies relationships and differences.60 It is one of the most efficient methods for condensing large amounts of factual or statistical data, making review for memorization highly effective.17

> [!WARNING] Limitation
> The main limitation is that it typically requires the categories to be known in advance, which can be challenging in a live lecture unless the structure is provided beforehand.58

> [!TIP] Best For
> Reviewing and summarizing content with comparable elements. It is ideal for comparing different theories across key dimensions, tracking historical events by categories (e.g., Date, Event, Key Figures, Significance), or organizing factual data in sciences.7
