## The Workflow (Standard Operating Procedure)

Having a structured process for creating notes ensures consistency and reduces friction, making it more likely that you'll stick with the habit. Follow these steps from the moment an idea strikes to its final, structured form.

1.  **Capture Immediately & Create:** The moment you encounter an interesting idea, create a new note in your system and paste the Universal Note Template.
2.  **Fill in the Title and Source:** Write a descriptive title and immediately record the source of the information. This prevents "orphaned" notes that have lost their original context.
3.  **The "Braindump":** Write down everything you think is important about the topic in the body of the note. Don't worry about structure or perfect phrasing at this stage. Just get the raw ideas down.
4.  **Refactor and Structure:** Now, shape the raw content. Organize your thoughts using headings and subheadings. Convert paragraphs into bulleted or numbered lists where appropriate. Apply strategic formatting (bold, italics) to add clarity.
5.  **Synthesize and Summarize:** Review what you've written and distill the absolute core of the idea. Write this distillation as the one-sentence summary at the top of the note. This is a critical thinking step.
6.  **Connect and Curate:** Read through your note and identify concepts that relate to other notes in your system. Create contextual links within the text. Then, take a moment to think about broader connections and add links to the "Related Notes" section at the bottom.
7.  **Finalize Metadata:** Complete the frontmatter by adding relevant tags and any aliases you might use to refer to this idea in the future.

By following this architecture and workflow, you will create a robust, interconnected, and highly personal knowledge base that not only stores what you learn but actively helps you think better. This is the essence of effective Personal Knowledge Management.
