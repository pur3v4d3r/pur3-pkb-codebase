> [!INFO] Active Participation & Selectivity
> Is to be selective at what I'm choosing to write down and how I choose to write. I MUST ACTIVLY participate with the material.

> [!NOTE] The Initial Process
> The best way to do this seems to be reading then thinking about what you have read or heard and then processing that information by the final act of writing it down.

> [!CAUTION] It Doesn't Stop There
> However it doesnt stop there.

> [!IMPORTANT] Review & Reinforce
> You must then actively go back to old notes to review and strengthen the neural pathways that have formed in the process of the notes creation.
