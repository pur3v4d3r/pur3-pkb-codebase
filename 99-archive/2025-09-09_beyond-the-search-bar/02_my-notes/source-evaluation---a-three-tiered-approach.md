> [!TLDR] Three Layers of Source Evaluation
> A thorough evaluation requires dissecting a source into its constituent layers: the author who created it, the publisher who disseminated it, and the content itself. A weakness or red flag in one layer should trigger heightened scrutiny of the others, as true credibility requires integrity across all three.


## Layer 1: The Author – Evaluating Credentials, Expertise, and Conflicts of Interest

The credibility of information often begins with the credibility of its creator.

### Credentials and Expertise
*   **Verification:** Confirm the author's qualifications are relevant to the topic.
*   **Indicators:** Look for academic degrees, institutional affiliations (e.g., university, research institute), and professional history.
*   **Publication History:** Examine their record using academic databases (Google Scholar, PubMed, ResearchGate). An extensive record of peer-reviewed publications on a subject indicates high credibility.
*   **Concerns:** An author with no prior experience in a field raises questions about the quality of their work.

### Conflicts of Interest (COI)
A COI is a potential for bias that could affect a researcher's work, undermining objectivity.

*   **Financial COIs:**
    *   Direct funding from a company benefiting from results.
    *   Personal consulting fees, salaries, or stock ownership in related companies.
    *   Pending patents.
*   **Non-Financial COIs:**
    *   Personal relationships.
    *   Political or ideological commitments.
    *   Academic rivalries.
    *   Deeply held personal beliefs that could sway research.
*   **Disclosure:** Reputable publications require authors to disclose potential COIs. The absence of such a statement or a lack of transparency about funding sources is a significant red flag.

## Layer 2: The Publisher – Assessing Reputation, Editorial Standards, and Mission

The entity that publishes and distributes information acts as a critical gatekeeper; its reputation and standards are a powerful proxy for content reliability.

### Reputation and Type
*   **Highly Reputable:** University presses (e.g., Harvard University Press) and established academic publishers (e.g., Wiley, Routledge) are generally considered highly credible.
*   **Academic Journals:** Inclusion in curated databases (e.g., Directory of Open Access Journals - DOAJ) or high citation metrics (e.g., Journal Citation Reports) are strong positive indicators.

### Editorial Standards
*   **Gold Standard:** A rigorous **peer-review process**, where experts in the field scrutinize work before publication.
*   **Reputable Publishers:** Will have a clearly described peer-review process, a public corrections policy, and often adhere to standards of professional bodies like the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE).
*   **Warning Signs ("Predatory" Publishers):** Vague or non-existent submission guidelines, promises of rapid publication, and charging significant fees to authors (suggesting a focus on profit over quality).

### Website-Specific Indicators (for online-only sources)
*   **Positive Signs:** A detailed "About Us" page and clear contact information.
*   **Domain Suffixes:**
    *   **.gov:** Restricted to U.S. government entities.
    *   **.edu:** Restricted to educational institutions.
    *   These lend a degree of credibility.
    *   **.org, .com, .net:** Can be registered by anyone and require much closer scrutiny, as a .org suffix does not automatically imply unbiased or reliable content.

## Layer 3: The Content – Deconstructing the Message

Even information from a credible author and publisher must be read critically.

### Distinguishing Fact from Opinion
*   **Fact:** A statement that can be proven or disproven with objective, verifiable evidence. A factual statement can be _incorrect_ (e.g., "The capital of France is Berlin" is an incorrect fact, not an opinion).
*   **Opinion:** A statement based on personal values, beliefs, or judgments that cannot be objectively proven true or false.
*   **News Media:** Distinguish between fact-based news reporting and subjective opinion/commentary sections (e.g., editorials, op-eds).
*   **Signal Words for Opinion:** Be wary of words like "good," "bad," "should," "best," or "worst."

### Identifying Logical Fallacies
*   A **logical fallacy** is a common error in reasoning that undermines the logic of an argument, rendering it invalid.
*   An argument can be built on true facts but still be fallacious and misleading. Recognizing these fallacies is crucial.

### Recognizing Emotionally Charged Language
*   **Emotive or "loaded" language** is deliberately used to provoke an emotional response (fear, anger, excitement) in the reader, often to persuade them by bypassing rational thought.
*   This is common in propaganda and biased reporting.
*   Be alert for strong verbs, dramatic adjectives, and sensory language designed to create an emotional picture rather than a sober, factual one.
*   An emotional response to a headline or article should signal a need for extra critical scrutiny.

| Ad Hominem                | Attacking the character of a person rather than their opinions or arguments.80                                                      | "Green Peace's strategies aren't effective because they are all dirty, lazy hippies".80                      |
| Straw Man                 | Oversimplifying an opponent's viewpoint and then attacking that hollow argument.80                                                  | "People who don't support the proposed state minimum wage increase hate the poor".80                         |
| Slippery Slope            | A conclusion based on the premise that if A happens, then a series of small steps will inevitably lead to a disastrous outcome Z.80 | "If we ban Hummers because they are bad for the environment, eventually the government will ban all cars".81 |
| Hasty Generalization      | A conclusion based on insufficient or biased evidence; rushing to a conclusion before all relevant facts are known.80               | "I had one female boss who was unfair. Therefore, all female bosses are unfair".82                           |
| False Dilemma (Either/Or) | Oversimplifying an argument by reducing it to only two sides or choices, ignoring other possibilities.80                            | "We can either stop using cars or destroy the earth".81                                                      |
