### SOP: Create a Smart Note

1. **Capture the spark (≤ 60 seconds).**
    Open a new note, paste the template, drop a working title and a quick placeholder summary like “TBD: about X from Y.”
2. **Ground the provenance (≤ 2 minutes).**
    Fill `source`, `created`. If this came from a book, add page or timestamp; if from you, write “personal synthesis.”
3. **Braindump (5–10 minutes).**
    In “What is the idea?” write freely **in your own words**. Do not format yet. Capture examples that made the idea click.
4. **Refactor into structure (5–10 minutes).**
   - Split the braindump into **What / Why / How**.
   - Convert scattered thoughts into bulleted lists (unordered) or numbered steps (ordered).
   - Add **bold** to the single sentence that carries each section’s main claim.
5. **Synthesize the one-sentence summary (2 minutes).**
    Return to the top and write a crisp, consequential statement: *“In short: … because … therefore …”*
6. **Contextual links (3–5 minutes).**
    Add 2–4 **link sentences** under “Contextual Links.” Each must include a *because* clause. Prefer atomic targets.
7. **Curate “Related Notes” (2–3 minutes).**
    Pick 3–7 neighbors and add a **short justification** for each. This is your recommendation engine for your future self.
8. **Finalize metadata (1–2 minutes).**
    Set `tags` (3–5 stable tags), `type`, and `status`. Add `aliases` if the idea has common alternate names.
9. **Micro-review (90 seconds).**
   - Can this note be understood by a stranger?
   - Does the summary truly say **why it matters**?
   - Are there at least two contextual links with explicit reasons?
10. **Maintain lightly (later).**
     When you touch the note again, update `updated` and add a line to **Changelog**. Promote `status` to `evergreen` once it feels stable.
