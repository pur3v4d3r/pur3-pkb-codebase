## 📃 Notes
#### **Identifying Argument Components**
- At its **most basic level**, an argument consists of **two parts:** a **conclusion** and **one or more premises.82**

* **The Conclusion** is the main claim or assertion that the author is trying to prove. It is the point the argument is trying to persuade the audience to accept.82  
* **The Premises** are the statements offered as evidence, reasons, or grounds in support of the conclusion.82
Identifying these components is the first step in reconstruction and analysis. While arguments in academic texts are rarely presented in a simple "premise, therefore conclusion" format, authors often use indicator words that signal the function of a statement.85

* **Premise Indicators** include words like *because*, *since*, *for*, *as*, and phrases like *for the reason that* or *as indicated by*.83  
* **Conclusion Indicators** include words like *therefore*, *thus*, *so*, *hence*, *consequently*, and phrases like *it follows that* or *we may conclude*.83
While these words are helpful clues, they are not always present. The most reliable method is to read a passage and ask: "What is the main point the author is trying to convince me of?" That is the conclusion. Then ask: "What reasons or evidence does the author provide to support that point?" Those are the premises.84
