# SIFT Method for Information Evaluation

The SIFT method, developed by Mike Caulfield, is a framework for quickly evaluating online information by shifting from deep single-source analysis to lateral fact-checking.

## Core Principles

*   **Purpose:** To quickly and effectively assess the reliability and context of online information.
*   **Approach:** Encourages lateral reading and external verification rather than intense scrutiny of a single source.

## The SIFT Steps

### S - Stop
*   **Pause and Reflect:** Before engaging or sharing, take a moment to consider the content.
*   **Assess Source Reputation:** Ask if you know the source; if not, investigate before proceeding.
*   **Check Emotional Response:** Be highly skeptical of content designed to provoke strong emotions, as it's often manipulative.

### I - Investigate the Source
*   **Lateral Reading:** Open a new tab to search for information about the author, publication, or organization.
*   **Goal:** Quickly determine their **expertise** and **agenda**.
*   **"Wikipedia Trick":** Use Wikipedia for a fast overview of a source's history, ownership, funding, and biases.
*   **Example:** Understand the context if a claim about milk benefits comes from the dairy industry.

### F - Find Better (or Trusted) Coverage
*   **Prioritize Claims:** If a claim is important, focus on finding reliable information about it, not on debunking a low-quality source.
*   **Ignore Low-Quality Sources:** Rather than analyzing questionable sources, seek out trusted reporting on the same topic.
*   **Strategy:** Search for coverage from **multiple, high-quality sources** (e.g., major news agencies, scientific organizations).

### T - Trace Claims to the Original Source
*   **Combat Secondhand Information:** Much online information is quoted, summarized, or clipped, which can distort context.
*   **Go "Upstream":** Find the primary source of the information.
*   **Applications:**
    *   For research findings, locate the **original study**.
    *   For video clips, find the **full video** for original context.
*   **Red Flag:** Be wary of sources that make claims without providing links or references to the original information.

| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Primary Strategy   | Lateral Reading (Investigating the source externally)                                           | Vertical Analysis (Evaluating the source's internal content)                                                                      |
| Core Question      | "Is this source credible and worth my time?"                                                    | "Is this specific content accurate and appropriate for my need?"                                                                  |
| Best Use Case      | Rapid evaluation of unfamiliar online sources, social media posts, and breaking news.           | In-depth analysis of a pre-vetted source for an academic paper, professional report, or important decision.                       |
| Key Strength       | Speed and efficiency; highly effective at identifying unreliable and deceptive sources quickly. | Thoroughness and structure; provides a detailed framework for content analysis.                                                   |
| Potential Weakness | May not provide enough detail for deep content analysis required for academic work.             | Impractical and inefficient for the high volume of information encountered daily; can be fooled by sophisticated deceptive sites. |

*   **S - Stop:**
> [!TLDR] Crucial First Move
> This is the crucial first move.
Before reading an article or watching a video, pause.41
> [!QUESTION] Key Questions to Ask
> Ask yourself two questions:
> [!QUESTION] Do I know this website or source and its reputation?
If the answer is no, you should not read or share it until you have investigated further.42 Second, check your own emotional response.
> [!WARNING] Emotional Manipulation
> Content designed to provoke a strong emotional reaction—such as anger, fear, or outrage—is often manipulative and should be approached with extreme skepticism.2
*   **I - Investigate the Source:**
> [!INFO] Lateral Reading in Action
> This is the direct application of lateral reading.
Instead of analyzing the source itself, get off the page and investigate its creator.42 Open a new tab and search for the name of the author, the publication, or the organization.
> [!INFO] Goal: Determine Expertise and Agenda
> The goal is to quickly determine expertise and agenda.42
> [!NOTE] The "Wikipedia Trick"
> A key tactic here is the "Wikipedia trick": using a Wikipedia article not as a citable source for a claim, but as a convenient tool to get a quick summary of a publication's history, ownership, funding, and known biases.39
> [!EXAMPLE] Context is Key
> For example, learning that a video promoting the benefits of milk was produced by the dairy industry is crucial context for interpretation.43
*   **F - Find Better (or Trusted) Coverage:**
> [!INFO] When the Claim Matters More Than the Source
> This move is for situations where the claim itself is more important than the specific source that delivered it to you.41
> [!TLDR] Strategy: Ignore Low-Quality, Find High-Quality
> Instead of wasting time analyzing a low-quality or questionable source, the best strategy is often to ignore it and find trusted reporting on the same topic from multiple, high-quality sources.40
> [!EXAMPLE] Efficient Verification
> For instance, if you see a claim from an unfamiliar advocacy group that koalas have been declared extinct, your most efficient move is not to investigate the group, but to search for coverage on the topic from major international news agencies or scientific organizations to see what the expert consensus is.42
*   **T - Trace Claims to the Original Source:**
> [!WARNING] Secondhand Information Can Be Distorted
> Much of the information on the internet is secondhand—it has been quoted, summarized, or clipped from an original source and can be easily distorted or stripped of its context in the process.40
> [!INFO] Go "Upstream" to Primary Sources
> This move involves going "upstream" to find the primary source of the information.45
If an article discusses the findings of a research study, trace it back to the original study to see if the findings are accurately represented. If you see a short video clip of a politician's speech, find the full video to see the original context.
> [!CAUTION] Missing References
> If a source makes claims but does not provide links or references to help you find the original information, that is a significant red flag.45
