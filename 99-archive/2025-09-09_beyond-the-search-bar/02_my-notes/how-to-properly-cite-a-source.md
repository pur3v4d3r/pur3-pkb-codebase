## Basic Steps for Citing Sources

Citing sources correctly involves a series of steps, from preparation to finalizing your paper. Here is a simple step-by-step approach for beginners:

1.  **Determine Which Citation Style to Use:** Identify the required citation style for your assignment or publication. This information may come from your instructor, a journal’s author guidelines, or your field’s conventions. Once you know (e.g., APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.), obtain a reliable reference for that style – for example, the official style manual or an online guide like the Purdue Online Writing Lab (OWL)[\[23\]](https://ohiostate.pressbooks.pub/choosingsources/chapter/steps-for-citing/#:~:text=Step%201%3A%20Choose%20Your%20Citation,Style).
    > [!CAUTION]
    > Each style has specific rules you’ll need to follow, so having the guide handy is important.

2.  **Add In-Text Citations (or Footnotes) as You Write:** Whenever you quote, paraphrase, or use information from a source, insert a citation **immediately** in your draft. Follow the format rules of your chosen style for in-text citations[\[24\]](https://ohiostate.pressbooks.pub/choosingsources/chapter/steps-for-citing/#:~:text=Step%202%3A%20Create%20In). For instance, in APA you’d add parentheses with author and year, in MLA you’d add author and page number, and in Chicago (NB) you’d add a footnote.

    > Make sure the citation clearly corresponds to the source and page of the material you used.

3.  **Identify the Source Type and Gather Details:** For each source, determine what kind of source it is (a book, journal article, website, etc.), since citation formats often depend on the source type[\[25\]](https://ohiostate.pressbooks.pub/choosingsources/chapter/steps-for-citing/#:~:text=Step%203%3A%20Determine%20the%20Kind,of%20Source). Then collect all the bibliographic details you’ll need for that source.
    > [!INFO]
    > Typically, this includes: **author(s) name(s)**, **title of the work**, **publication date**, and other details like **publisher** (for books), **journal name, volume, issue, page range** (for articles), or **URL/DOI** (for online sources).
    > [!NOTE]
    > It’s wise to keep a record of these details as you do your research.

4.  **Format the Full Citation for the Reference List/Bibliography:** Using the rules of your citation style, format each source’s full citation to go in the reference list or bibliography at the end of your paper[\[26\]](https://ohiostate.pressbooks.pub/choosingsources/chapter/steps-for-citing/#:~:text=,Are%20Very%20Specific). Check the style guidelines for the exact order and punctuation. For example, APA requires author last name followed by initials, year in parentheses, title in italics for books, etc., whereas MLA requires author’s full name, title in italics, publisher, year, and so on.
    > [!CAUTION]
    > Pay attention to details like italicization, capitalization, commas, and periods – styles are very specific about these.
    > [!INFO]
    > Many styles also require a hanging indent for entries (where the second line of a citation is indented).

5.  **Double-Check Consistency and Completeness:** Before finalizing your work, ensure that **every in-text citation has a matching entry** in the reference list or bibliography, and vice versa. Also, verify that the formatting of all citations is consistent and follows the style rules.
    > [!NOTE]
    > It can be helpful to use a checklist or compare your citations against examples from the style guide.
    > [!WARNING]
    > Little details (like comma vs. period placement) matter in formal citation styles.

Following these steps will help you create a properly cited paper. It may seem complicated at first, but with practice it becomes more routine.
> [!TLDR]
> Remember that citation is as much about _record-keeping_ as writing – staying organized with your sources from the beginning will save you a lot of stress later.
