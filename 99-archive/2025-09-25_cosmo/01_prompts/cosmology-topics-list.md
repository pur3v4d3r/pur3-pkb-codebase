# Series of Planetary and Cosmic Topics for Long‑Form Educational Papers

> [!info]
> Below is a curated list of topics covering planetary bodies and cosmic structures. Each entry includes a **Topic** and a **Prompt/Instruction for the AI**. The prompts are intentionally detailed so that the AI can produce rich, long‑form educational articles akin to episodes of _The Universe_. These prompts encourage exploration of origins, composition, dynamic processes, and the broader significance of each subject—while also inviting philosophical reflection on why these phenomena matter to our understanding of the cosmos.

### Topic 1 – The Sun

**Prompt/Instruction for the AI:** Explore the Sun as a main‑sequence star. Describe its structure from core to corona, the process of nuclear fusion that converts hydrogen to helium, and how energy travels through radiation and convection zones before emerging as sunlight[1]([https://www.space.com/22437-main-sequence-star.html#:~:text=Main%20sequence%20stars%20fuse%20hydrogen,to%20200%20times%20as%20massive](https://www.space.com/22437-main-sequence-star.html#:~:text=Main%20sequence%20stars%20fuse%20hydrogen,to%20200%20times%20as%20massive)). Explain the solar cycle, sunspots and flares, and the effect of solar wind on the heliosphere and planetary atmospheres. Discuss the Sun’s formation from a protostellar cloud and estimate its life expectancy on the main sequence. Conclude by reflecting on the Sun’s role in stabilising the solar system and sustaining life on Earth, and consider what eventually happens when it exhausts its fuel.

### Topic 2 – Mercury: The Extreme World Next to the Sun

**Prompt/Instruction for the AI:** Provide a comprehensive overview of Mercury. Explain why it is the smallest planet and only slightly larger than Earth’s Moon, and describe its surface features and composition. Discuss its extremely thin exosphere made of atoms blasted from the surface by the solar wind[2]([https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/all-about-mercury/en/#:~:text=Mercury%20is%20the%20smallest%20planet,Venus%20is%20hotter](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/all-about-mercury/en/#:~:text=Mercury%20is%20the%20smallest%20planet,Venus%20is%20hotter)), its long days (≈59 Earth days) and short orbital period (88 days), and the huge swings in temperature between day and night. Explore reasons for its lack of moons and substantial atmosphere, its high density and iron‑rich core, and how past bombardment shaped its surface. Reflect on what Mercury tells us about planetary formation close to stars.

### Topic 3 – Venus: The Runaway Greenhouse

**Prompt/Instruction for the AI:** Discuss Venus in detail. Describe its dense carbon‑dioxide atmosphere and sulfuric acid clouds that trap heat, making it the hottest planet despite orbiting farther from the Sun than Mercury[3]([https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/all-about-venus/en/#:~:text=Even%20though%20Venus%20isn%27t%20the,be%20puddles%20of%20melted%20liquid](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/all-about-venus/en/#:~:text=Even%20though%20Venus%20isn%27t%20the,be%20puddles%20of%20melted%20liquid)).
