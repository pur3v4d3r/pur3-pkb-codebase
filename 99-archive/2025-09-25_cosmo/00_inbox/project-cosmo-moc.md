> [!the-purpose]
> This is "Project: Cosmo" and this is the [[project-cosmo-moc]] the main hub for this research/practice project. The main goal here is to focus on my ability to learn through Active Reading Techniques, by going through the steps required for this process of effective learning. I will be using a pre-selected set of topics to run through an AI. This AI's name is Gemini, and one of Gemini's abilities is to construct specialized "Gems." Basically a "Gem", is a mini AI with its own specific set of instructions, to which it will follow every time a task is given or request made. This "Gem's" name is "Cosmo" and the goal is to is to construct education/scientific styled articles on Cosmology, Astrology, The Universe, Etc., on topics of my choosing. These articles are meant to be a practice step on my road to conducting research for this [[PKB]] also know as an [[Obsidian Vault]]. They are NOT meant to replace the real source of information which would be academics. It's simply a way of creating substantial amounts of content in a manner of my choosing so that I may in turn practice and hone my skills at Learning, Academic Research, and acquiring Knowledge for my [[PKB]].
