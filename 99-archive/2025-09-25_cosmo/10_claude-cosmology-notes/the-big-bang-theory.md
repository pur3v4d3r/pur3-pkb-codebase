# The Big Bang Theory

> *The prevailing scientific model explaining the early development and evolution of the universe*

## 🌟 Core Concept

The Big Bang Theory describes the universe as having expanded from an initial state of high density and temperature approximately **13.8 billion years ago**. Contrary to popular misconception, it doesn't describe an explosion in space, but rather the expansion of space itself.

## 📋 Key Evidence

### 1. Cosmic Expansion ([[Hubble's Law and Cosmic Expansion]])
- Galaxies receding with velocities proportional to distance
- Space itself is expanding, stretching wavelengths of light
- Links: [[Edwin Hubble]], [[Redshift and Distance Measurement]]

### 2. Cosmic Microwave Background ([[Cosmic Microwave Background]])
- Thermal radiation left over from when universe became transparent
- Nearly perfect blackbody spectrum at 2.725 K
- Tiny fluctuations reveal early structure formation seeds

### 3. Primordial Nucleosynthesis ([[nucleosynthesis]])
- Predicted abundances of light elements (H, He, Li)
- Matches observed ratios in oldest stars
- Requires specific conditions only present in early universe

### 4. Large-Scale Structure
- Distribution of galaxies matches predictions
- Formation of [[Cosmic Web Structure]]
- Links to [[Dark Matter]] simulations

## 🕐 Timeline Integration

The Big Bang is the starting point of our [[Timeline of the Universe]]:
- **t = 0**: Planck Era (quantum gravity dominates)
- **t < 10⁻³² seconds**: [[Cosmic Inflation]] period
- **t = 1-20 minutes**: Big Bang Nucleosynthesis
- **t = 380,000 years**: Recombination (CMB released)

## 🤔 Common Misconceptions

### "Explosion in Empty Space"
- **Reality**: Expansion of space itself
- No center point or edge to expansion
- Every point was once the "center"

### "Created Matter from Nothing"
- **Reality**: Describes evolution from initial state
- Doesn't address ultimate origin question
- May connect to [[Quantum Cosmology]] theories

## 🔬 Modern Refinements

### Inflation Theory ([[Cosmic Inflation]])
- Solves [[The Horizon Problem]] and [[The Flatness Problem]]
- Explains large-scale homogeneity and isotropy
- Predicts gravitational wave signatures

### Lambda-CDM Model ([[Lambda-CDM Model]])
- Standard model incorporating dark components
- 68.3% [[Dark Energy]], 26.8% [[Dark Matter]], 4.9% ordinary matter
- Precisely matches multiple observational tests

## 🎯 Current Research Frontiers

### Pre-Big Bang Physics
- What came before? ([[Multiverse Theories]])
- Quantum gravity effects ([[Quantum Cosmology]])
- Cyclic universe models

### Precision Measurements
- Hubble tension (different H₀ measurements)
- Dark energy equation of state
- Primordial gravitational waves

## 💡 Key Insights

1. **Time had a beginning** - Fundamental shift from eternal universe models
2. **Space expands** - Distances between objects increase without objects moving
3. **Universe was denser and hotter** - Enables nucleosynthesis and recombination
4. **Structure formed gradually** - From quantum fluctuations to galaxies
