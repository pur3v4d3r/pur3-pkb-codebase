# Galaxy Formation

> *From quantum ripples to spiral galaxies - how tiny fluctuations became the cosmic structures we see today*

## 🌌 The Cosmic Construction Project

Galaxy formation is one of the universe's most complex and beautiful processes, transforming the nearly uniform early cosmos into the rich tapestry of galaxies, stars, and planets we observe today. It's the story of how [[Dark Matter]] and ordinary matter collaborated to build cosmic architecture from primordial seeds.

## 🧱 The Building Blocks

### Initial Conditions from [[Cosmic Inflation]]
- **Quantum Fluctuations**: Tiny density variations (δρ/ρ ~ 10⁻⁵)
- **Scale-Invariant**: Similar amplitude on all relevant scales
- **Gaussian**: Random, uncorrelated fluctuations
- **Preservation**: Frozen into [[Cosmic Microwave Background]] at recombination

### Dark Matter: The Scaffolding ([[Dark Matter]])
- **Dominant Component**: ~85% of all matter
- **Early Start**: Begins clustering immediately after [[Timeline of the Universe|recombination]]
- **Collisionless**: Doesn't interact with radiation, cools efficiently
- **Gravitational**: Only interacts via gravity - pure structure formation

### Ordinary Matter (Baryons): The Visible Component
- **Minority**: ~15% of total matter
- **Coupled**: Strongly interacted with photons until recombination
- **Delayed Start**: Couldn't cluster until universe became transparent
- **Complex Physics**: Cooling, heating, chemistry, star formation

## 🕐 Timeline of Structure Formation ([[Timeline of the Universe]])

### Phase 1: Dark Ages (380,000 - 100 million years)
- **Dark Matter Growth**: Halos begin forming via gravitational collapse
- **Baryon Dynamics**: Gas slowly falls into dark matter potential wells
- **First Structures**: Smallest scale fluctuations collapse first
- **No Light**: Universe is dark - no stars formed yet

### Phase 2: Cosmic Dawn (~100-200 million years)
- **First Stars**: Population III stars form in dark matter minihalos
- **Properties**: Massive (100-1000 M☉), metal-free, short-lived
- **Impact**: First light since recombination, heavy element production
- **Beginning**: Start of stellar feedback and chemical enrichment

### Phase 3: Reionization (150 million - 1 billion years)
- **Ionizing Radiation**: First stars and quasars reionize universe
- **Feedback**: Radiation heats gas, suppresses small galaxy formation
- **Patchy Process**: Occurs in bubbles around first light sources
- **Observable**: 21cm hydrogen line signatures (future observations)

### Phase 4: Galaxy Assembly Era (1-10 billion years)
- **Peak Formation**: Most galaxies form during this period
- **Hierarchical**: Smaller structures merge to form larger ones
- **Morphology**: Disk and elliptical galaxies establish
- **Chemical Evolution**: Metal enrichment from stellar nucleosynthesis

### Phase 5: Modern Era (Last 5 billion years)
- **[[Dark Energy]] Domination**: Structure growth slows significantly
- **Mature Galaxies**: Most massive galaxies already formed
- **Star Formation Decline**: Universe becoming less active
- **Local Evolution**: Galaxy mergers, morphological transformation

## 🏗️ Hierarchical Structure Formation

### Bottom-Up Assembly
- **Small First**: Smallest fluctuations collapse earliest
- **Mergers**: Small halos merge to form larger structures
- **Hierarchy**: Dark matter halos within halos within halos
- **Self-Similar**: Same physics on all scales

### Dark Matter Halo Properties
```
Halo Mass Range:
- Dwarf Galaxies: 10⁹ - 10¹⁰ M☉
- Milky Way-type: ~10¹² M☉  
- Giant Ellipticals: 10¹³ M☉
- Galaxy Clusters: 10¹⁴ - 10¹⁵ M☉

Density Profile: 
ρ(r) ∝ r⁻³ at large radii (NFW profile)
Central cusp or core (observational debate)
```

### Baryon Physics Complications
- **Gas Dynamics**: Shock heating, cooling, pressure support
- **Star Formation**: Complex process involving molecular clouds
- **Stellar Feedback**: Supernovae, stellar winds affect gas
- **AGN Feedback**: Supermassive black holes regulate growth

## 🌟 From Gas to Stars

### Cooling and Condensation
- **Virial Temperature**: Gas heated to ~10⁶ K by gravitational infall
- **Cooling**: Atomic and molecular line emission cools gas
- **Condensation**: Cool gas settles to halo center
- **Disk Formation**: Angular momentum conservation forms disks

### Star Formation Process
```
Gas Cloud → Molecular Cloud → Star Formation → Feedback

Timescales:
- Dynamical: ~10⁷ years (gravitational collapse)
- Cooling: ~10⁸ years (atomic cooling)  
- Star Formation: ~10⁸ years (cloud processing)
- Chemical: ~10⁹ years (metal enrichment)
```

### Population Types
- **Population III**: First stars (no metals, very massive)
- **Population II**: Low metallicity (globular clusters, halo stars)
- **Population I**: High metallicity (disk stars like our Sun)

## 🌌 Galaxy Types and Morphology

### Hubble Classification
```
Ellipticals (E0-E7):
- Shape: Ellipsoidal, smooth
- Stars: Old, red population
- Formation: Early, rapid collapse + mergers

Spirals (Sa, Sb, Sc):
- Shape: Disk + central bulge
- Stars: Mixed old/young populations
- Formation: Gradual disk assembly

Irregulars:
- Shape: Asymmetric, disturbed
- Stars: Often actively star-forming
- Formation: Mergers, interactions
```
