# Matter-Antimatter Asymmetry

> *The reason we exist - why the universe chose matter over antimatter in the cosmic coin flip of creation*

## ⚖️ The Ultimate Survival Story

One of the universe's most profound mysteries is why anything exists at all. According to our best theories, the [[Timeline of the Universe|Big Bang]] should have created equal amounts of matter and antimatter, which would have annihilated each other completely, leaving behind only photons. Instead, we observe a universe filled with matter - stars, galaxies, planets, and life itself.

## 💥 The Great Annihilation That Didn't Happen

### Expected Symmetric Creation
```
Big Bang Theory Prediction:
Every particle ↔ Equal antiparticle creation
Perfect symmetry between matter and antimatter

Expected Result:
Matter + Antimatter → Pure radiation
Universe: Only photons, no atoms, no structure
Reality: We wouldn't exist to ask the question
```

### Observational Reality
- **Matter Dominance**: Universe is 99.9999999% matter
- **Antimatter Scarcity**: Only tiny traces in cosmic rays
- **Survival Rate**: ~1 in 1 billion matter particles survived
- **Our Existence**: Proof that asymmetry occurred

### The Numbers
```
For every billion antimatter particles:
1,000,000,001 matter particles were created

Final Score:
- 1 billion matter-antimatter pairs annihilated
- 1 matter particle survived
- This tiny excess became everything we see
```

## 🕰️ When Did Asymmetry Arise? ([[Timeline of the Universe]])

### Primordial Baryogenesis (Very Early Universe)
- **Timing**: First microseconds after Big Bang  
- **Temperature**: >10¹² K (100 GeV energy scale)
- **Physics**: Grand Unified Theory energy scales
- **Mechanism**: Fundamental particle interactions

### Electroweak Baryogenesis  
- **Timing**: ~10⁻¹² seconds after Big Bang
- **Temperature**: ~10¹⁵ K (electroweak transition)
- **Physics**: Higgs field and electroweak symmetry breaking
- **Status**: Insufficient CP violation in Standard Model

### Alternative Scenarios
- **Leptogenesis**: Asymmetry in leptons transferred to baryons
- **Spontaneous**: Asymmetry from quantum fluctuations
- **Pre-existing**: Built into initial conditions

## 🔬 The Sakharov Conditions

### Andrei Sakharov (1967): Three Requirements
For matter-antimatter asymmetry to develop dynamically:

#### 1. **Baryon Number Violation**
- **Definition**: Processes that change total number of baryons
- **Need**: To go from zero net baryon number to excess
- **GUTs**: Grand Unified Theories predict proton decay
- **Status**: Required, predicted by theory, not yet observed

#### 2. **C and CP Violation**  
- **C Violation**: Charge conjugation symmetry breaking
- **CP Violation**: Combined charge-parity symmetry breaking
- **Need**: Distinguish matter from antimatter
- **Observation**: CP violation discovered in K-mesons, B-mesons

#### 3. **Departure from Thermal Equilibrium**
- **Need**: Allow asymmetry to develop and persist
- **Equilibrium**: Would wash out any developing asymmetry
- **Mechanisms**: Phase transitions, particle decays, expansion
- **Cosmic Setting**: Expanding universe naturally out of equilibrium

## ⚛️ Observed CP Violation

### Kaon System (1964 Discovery)
- **Nobel Prize**: Cronin and Fitch (1980)
- **Process**: Neutral kaon mixing and decay
- **Magnitude**: ~10⁻³ asymmetry
- **Significance**: First proof CP symmetry can be violated

### B-Meson System  
- **Experiments**: BaBar, Belle, LHCb
- **Larger Effects**: ~10⁻¹ asymmetries in some processes
- **Standard Model**: Consistent with Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa theory
- **Insufficient**: Not enough to explain cosmic asymmetry

### The CP Problem
```
Standard Model CP Violation:
- Magnitude: ~10^-10 asymmetry possible
- Cosmic Observation: ~10^-10 asymmetry needed
- Status: Barely sufficient, requires fine-tuning

Missing: Strong CP Problem
- QCD should have large CP violation
- Not observed experimentally  
- May be solved by axions
```

## 🌌 Theoretical Mechanisms

### Grand Unified Theory (GUT) Baryogenesis
- **Energy Scale**: ~10¹⁶ GeV (near Planck scale)
- **Particles**: Heavy GUT bosons decay asymmetrically
- **Timing**: First 10⁻³⁶ seconds after Big Bang
- **Challenge**: Diluted by [[Cosmic Inflation]]

### Electroweak Baryogenesis
- **Phase Transition**: Higgs field acquires vacuum expectation value
- **Bubble Walls**: CP violation at phase boundary
- **Temperature**: ~100 GeV (electroweak scale)
- **Problem**: Standard Model transition too smooth

### Leptogenesis
```
Mechanism:
1. Heavy right-handed neutrinos decay
2. CP violation creates lepton asymmetry  
3. Sphaleron processes convert leptons → baryons
4. Net baryon asymmetry results

Advantages:
✅ Uses seesaw mechanism for neutrino masses
✅ Natural CP violation source
✅ Occurs at intermediate energy scales
✅ Not diluted by inflation
```

### Affleck-Dine Mechanism
- **Scalar Fields**: Squark/slepton fields in supersymmetry
- **Flat Directions**: Fields roll along flat potential
- **CP Violation**: Complex phases in superpotential
- **Fragmentation**: Field breaks up, creates baryon asymmetry

## 🔍 Current Experimental Searches

### Proton Decay Experiments
- **Prediction**: Grand unified theories predict proton decay
- **Searches**: Super-Kamiokande, Hyper-K, DUNE
- **Current Limits**: Proton lifetime > 10³⁴ years
- **Significance**: Would confirm baryon number violation

### CP Violation Studies
- **LHCb**: Precision measurements of B and D meson decays
- **T2K/NOvA**: Neutrino CP violation searches
- **Electric Dipole Moments**: Search for new sources of CP violation
- **Atomic Physics**: Precision measurements of fundamental symmetries

### Neutron-Antineutron Oscillations
- **Process**: Neutron spontaneously converts to antineutron
- **Baryon Violation**: ΔB = 2 process
- **Experiments**: Search for oscillations in neutron beams
- **Limits**: No oscillations observed, strong constraints

## 🧮 Quantitative Requirements

### Baryon-to-Photon Ratio
```
η_B = n_B / n_γ ≈ 6 × 10^-10

Where:
n_B = baryon number density  
n_γ = photon number density

From CMB: η_B = 6.04 ± 0.08 × 10^-10
From BBN: η_B = (5.8 ± 0.4) × 10^-10

Remarkable agreement between early and late universe!
```

### Connection to [[nucleosynthesis]]
- **Baryon Density**: Controls nuclear reaction rates
- **Light Elements**: He, D, Li abundances depend on η_B
- **Consistency**: BBN and CMB give same baryon asymmetry
- **Validation**: Independent confirmation of asymmetry
