## GOAL

Talk to Doctor Davis about getting a therapist.

## NOTES and THOUGHTS

The extreme increase in anxiety over even thinking about going to see a therapist. Why does this happen?

- The worry or fear that this is going to completely shift everything. That everything is going to change.
  - What is Everything? That some how everything is going to be different. As in, maybe my view of the world will change in the extreme and that may be scary.
  - Or possibly that the way people including my parents look at me, It may change to a negative outlook or demeaner.
  - Everyone important to me could change their views towards me. Right now there not at either extreme but more in the lower middle. This could potentially, radically shift that stance towards the perceived negative end of that spectrum.
- In looking for a therapist, What are the best routes? Should i try out some type of online therapy in the beginning?
  - This could potential alleviate the anxiety of going some place every "X" amount of time.
    - I could start via a simple text or email. (Thus, allowing me to fully express my thoughts and views. Giving me the breathing room needed, in order for my responses to alleviate my in ability to articulate my thoughts auditorily.)
    - Starting from Email is the preferred method so far.
    - **Note:** (Look into online therapy resources.)

- Going to do this therapy consistently. Seeing the person even when I know I don't want to. What should I do in this situation? (Not just go..)
  - My plan above, to use email, this should allow for this to be a manageable experience.(every time that i need to see the therapist.) In turn allowing me to see the therapist on the schedule we agree upon. (which ever solution will help my needs the best is obviously the right choice here.)

- Trusting a therapist. How?
  - How do I meet some one new and open up? That's going to be very difficult.
  - Again I'm thinking the email or text messaging route to be the best as far as getting in the door and starting the journey that this will be. Once I have established a relationship with the therapist I may be able to expand on this into other areas, video calls for one.

All of this depend on whether or not the therapist is willing to communicate through email, Just until we an establish a relationship, and I feel comfortable in communicating these inner thoughts to a complete stranger. However I am open to their (the Therapist) and Doctor Davis's suggestions for how to approach this in the best and most productive way possible. I'm very keen on getting the help that I need. I do NOT want to continue doing these things that constantly hurt those around me.



## NEXT THOUGHTS, STEPS, ACTIONS



## GOAL

***I need a to find a therapist suitable for my needs.***

To do this I will need to speak with Dr Davis today, during our appointment. I need to ask her for her personal recommendation for my choices on therapy. Basically, express to her that I'm interested in starting therapy, but have some concerns.

My main concern would be the initial starting phase of this. My concerns lie in the fact that I'm not very good at articulating my thoughts into speech, It seems my mind moves way quicker than my lips do, and I'm really uncomfortable in meeting new people. Especially talking, and here I'll need to express my inner thoughts to complete stranger. So my purposed plan would be to find either a therapist that she recommends or to find some type of online therapy that allows for these types of communications in the beginning phases of therapy. And go from there.

## Talking Points



**Concerns**

- Concern of meeting a new therapist and trying to make it work
- Concerns of talking with this person and expressing myself adequately
- Concern that this may be achievable through some sort of text based communication (I.e. Email)
- Contemplating on, maybe using some sort of online therapy because I know they offer these textual based communications.
- Concerns with finding the right therapist
