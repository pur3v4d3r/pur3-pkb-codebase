When designing Mom and possible Dads PKB don't impose rigid guidelines for them to follow they must use the system, and gain a reward from the system to engage with it and continue to engage with it.

They have to build it themselves I can only start the journey by giving them the appropriate tools. They are intelligent and capable of constructing their own possible solutions to the problems they each have individually.
Think about [[Constructivist Learning]].

Design challenges for them to solve on their own whilst using the PKB.
The PKB should be a supportive addition in solving BOTH the actual problem and the PKB problems.


```
For PKB systems, this translates to a clear design imperative: every aspect of system architecture should be evaluated against its impact on autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Does this feature enhance or undermine user self-direction? Does this workflow create opportunities for mastery or generate perpetual frustration? Does this system design isolate users or facilitate connection to a supportive community? Systems that consistently satisfy these needs become psychologically "sticky"—users return not out of guilt or obligation but because interaction with the system itself is intrinsically rewarding.

> 1. Novice users, the system should present manageable initial challenges—capturing a note, retrieving it later, making a simple connection—that can be accomplished successfully with existing skills.
> 2. As competence grows, the system should reveal progressively more sophisticated capabilities: advanced linking strategies, query composition, network visualization, emergent pattern recognition.
> 3. The system itself becomes a scaffold for increasingly complex knowledge work, with each level of mastery opening new possibilities for challenge.
