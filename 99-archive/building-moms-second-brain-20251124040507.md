They've invested heavily in upfront design but have no feedback about whether their choices actually work. When they finally try to use the system, they discover mismatches between design and reality that require major restructuring.

Within days, patterns emerge: certain types of information need different treatment, some retrieval strategies work better than others, particular workflows prove more sustainable than alternatives. The system evolves organically, shaped by constant feedback from actual use. After months, this second system—though never "perfectly" designed—functions far more effectively because every element has been tested and refined through real-world use.
