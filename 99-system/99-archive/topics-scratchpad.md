**Prompt-Template**-*for-running-through-these-Topics*

```
I've been working in my PKB in Obsidian, reading various reports, and I've come across a few on {{Enter Text Here}}. I'm very interested in this concept, and would like to dive deep into this, whilst learning as much as I possibly can in the process. And integration into my PKB, in Obsidian. I have some questions regarding this subject: What techniques are commonly used with this? How do you go about implementing it, and what are the common downsides? How do you begin to master these skills, to push beyond surface level understanding and get to the depth required for expert level understanding? What are the best practices for engaging with these processes, with the purpose of facilitating growth and self development inside a PKB atmosphere?. What are the best practices for engaging with these processes, with the purpose of facilitating growth and self development in general? How do these ideas connect and work with Andragogical (Adult-Learning)?

**Recommend 6–8 topics** based on the information I've told you, with *the goal of answering my questions through the use of these topics*.

# Prompt
**Topic Idea**: `Workflow Productivity`
```
These are some things I `brainstormed a moment ago`. They are on various things I would like to both **understand and implement** into my *self development project*. **Use** these to develop an idea of what it is that *I want to learn* and then **generate** a set of topics that will *start me on the right path towards learning these*.

**Brainstormed Thoughts**:
- What are the *Workflow Theories, Frameworks, Systems, Processes, Tools*, Etc?
- What is the Workflow/Flow Zone?
- How to have good workflow?
- Techniques for developing high level workflow.
- Productivity techniques for high level workflow.
- How to measure workflow and implement any necessary changes?
- How to get into the workflow zone?
- How to design a good workflow?
- What make a workflow work?
- What makes a workflow feel right?

# **Cosmology Topics**

 1. [ ] Karl Schwarzschild—a German astrophysicist serving on the Russian front during World War I, solved one of Einsteins General Relativity Equations for a not spinning singularity.
2. The Friedman Equations
[PROMPT]
```
I'm currently studying Cosmology on my own, and would like to learn more about **{{}}**. My main problem is this. I have now background in Mathematics or Science, and the results from my prompt/instruction are too mathematical, so I want you to keep that active while you generate these topics. These topics need to be both highly educational and still be challenging enough for me to [A] stay focused, and [B] that I can actively participate with the reading material. So that, to further my understanding of the current domain.
