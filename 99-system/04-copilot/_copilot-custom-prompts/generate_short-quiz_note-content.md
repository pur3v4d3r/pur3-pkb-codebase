Act as a Socratic tutor. Based on the content of my note below, generate a short quiz to test my understanding of the key concepts. Include the following question types:
- 2 multiple-choice questions.
- 2 open-ended "explain why" or "explain how" questions.
- 1 challenging question that requires me to synthesize an answer, not just recall a fact.

Do not provide the answers immediately.
