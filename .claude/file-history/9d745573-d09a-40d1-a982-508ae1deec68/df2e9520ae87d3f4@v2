# Project Tracker

> [!abstract] Purpose
> Central registry of ongoing vault projects, system enhancements, and multi-session work. Prevents context loss and enables strategic prioritization.

## 🚀 Active Projects

### 1. Memory System Implementation
**Status**: `In Progress` | **Priority**: `High` | **Started**: 2025-12-16

**Objective**: Establish persistent context across Claude sessions to eliminate session amnesia.

**Components**:
- [x] Create 00-meta directory structure
- [x] Build session-memory.md (active context)
- [x] Build user-preferences.md (workflow patterns)
- [x] Build vault-map.md (structure tracking)
- [x] Build project-tracker.md (this file)
- [x] Update CLAUDE.md with memory protocols
- [ ] Test session persistence across restart
- [ ] Document usage workflow

**Next Actions**:
1. Integrate memory system into CLAUDE.md system prompt
2. Establish session start/end protocols
3. Test multi-session continuity

### 2. Self-Documenting Dataview System Adaptation

**Status**: `In Progress` | **Priority**: `High` | **Started**: 2025-12-16

**Objective**: Adapt self-documenting dataview system for general PKB knowledge work, creating emergent intelligence through automated concept tracking and discovery queries.

**Components**:

- [x] Analyze existing self-documenting dataview documentation
- [ ] Analyze user's vault structure and domain needs
- [ ] Design custom metadata schema for user's PKB domains
- [ ] Create production-ready concept note templates
- [ ] Create application note templates for different use cases
- [ ] Generate domain-specific discovery queries
- [ ] Create dashboard queries for vault-wide intelligence
- [ ] Test system with sample notes
- [ ] Document system usage and customization guide

**Next Actions**:
1. Analyze vault structure to identify key domains (projects, research, notes, etc.)
2. Design metadata schema for each domain type
3. Create custom templates adapted to user's workflow

### 3. Sequential Prompt Engineering System (SPES)

**Status**: `In Progress` | **Priority**: `High` | **Started**: 2025-12-16

**Objective**: Unified system integrating component-based prompt management, sequential workflow decomposition, and intelligent auto-discovery through metadata. Claude assists with problem decomposition, component retrieval, and learns from usage patterns.

**Architecture - Three Pillars**:

**1. Component Library**
- Atomic components (personas, instructions, constraints, formats)
- Composite workflows (multi-step prompt chains)
- Specialized domain templates
- Location: `02-projects/_spes-sequential-prompt-engineering-system/02-component-library/`

**2. Sequential Workflow Engine**
- Problem decomposition templates
- Context handoff protocols
- Multi-turn conversation management
- Content/context isolation strategies
- Location: `02-projects/_spes-sequential-prompt-engineering-system/03-sequential-workflows/`

**3. Intelligence Layer**
- Self-documenting dataview integration
- 16 PKB integration systems (epistemic encoding, relationship typing, application contexts)
- Usage analytics and pattern discovery
- Component relationship auto-discovery
- Location: `02-projects/_spes-sequential-prompt-engineering-system/04-intelligence-layer/`

**Implementation Decision**: **Option A Selected** ✅
- User chose: Unified project structure + Claude librarian instruction sets
- Rationale: Memory system critical for cross-session continuity

**Phase 1 Foundation - COMPLETED** (2025-12-16):
- [x] Full directory structure created (14 subdirectories)
- [x] 7 Claude librarian instruction files created:
  - [x] 00-librarian-core-identity.md (Prime directive, session protocols)
  - [x] 01-component-management-sop.md (Create/modify/retire procedures)
  - [x] 02-sequential-workflow-protocols.md (Decomposition strategies)
  - [x] 03-context-handoff-procedures.md (Multi-turn context management)
  - [x] 04-quality-assurance-checklist.md (Validation standards)
  - [x] 05-metadata-tagging-standards.md (Metadata specifications)
  - [x] 06-usage-analytics-protocols.md (Learning & pattern detection)
- [x] Project meta documentation:
  - [x] project-charter.md (Vision, objectives, success metrics)
  - [x] architecture-overview.md (Technical system design)
- [ ] implementation-roadmap.md (Next: phased execution plan)

**Next Actions** (Phase 2):
1. Create implementation-roadmap.md with detailed phase breakdown
2. Migrate existing prompt work into component library (10-20 initial components)
3. Document 5 core workflow patterns from existing work
4. Test first real workflow using SPES
5. Begin usage tracking and pattern detection

**Key Reference Notes**:
- [[reference-comprehensive-claude-prompt-component-librarian-2025111004]]
- [[reference-technical-llm-pkb-integration-systems-2025121411]]
- [[reference-technical-component-librarian-claude-project-2025111218]]

**Project Location**: `02-projects/_spes-sequential-prompt-engineering-system/`

**Notes**:
- Foundation complete: Claude now has full operational instructions
- Memory system integrated: Claude reads instruction files at session start
- Ready for component population phase
- Prompt engineering chosen as first domain (bounded, immediate utility, clear metrics)
- Sequential prompting + Component library = multiplicative value
- Self-doc dataview provides cross-session memory Claude lacks

## 📋 Backlog

### Vault Maintenance
- **Resolve Directory Duplication**: `01-daily-notes/` vs `01_daily-notes/`
- **Investigate Database Naming**: `000_databsae/` (typo or intentional?)
- **Separator Standardization**: Decide on hyphen vs underscore convention

### Graph Health
- **Orphan Detection**: Scan for notes with 0 links
- **Ghost Link Mapping**: Find `[[broken-links]]` to non-existent notes
- **MOC Opportunities**: Cluster analysis for 5+ related notes

### Automation
- **Vault Stats Script**: Auto-update vault-map.md metrics
- **Session Logger**: Git hooks for automatic session commits
- **Link Validator**: Pre-commit check for broken references

---

## ✅ Completed Projects
