## 🎯 When to Use This Component

**Ideal Scenarios**:
- ✅ Generating **reference notes** requiring exhaustive coverage (1500-4000+ words)
- ✅ Creating **educational content** with pedagogical scaffolding
- ✅ Building **knowledge graph** through systematic wiki-link identification
- ✅ Producing **Obsidian-native** formatted content (callouts, YAML, inline fields)
- ✅ Requiring **self-check loops** for quality assurance
- ✅ Applying **Chain-of-Density** information layering

**Suboptimal Scenarios**:
- ❌ Simple queries requiring brief, concise answers (depth mandate creates overhead)
- ❌ Speed-critical applications (ReAct reasoning adds ~30% latency)
- ❌ Non-Obsidian output targets (formatting protocols are vault-specific)
- ❌ Conversational/chat contexts without knowledge base integration

## 🔗 Works Well With

### Synergistic Components
1. **[[format-inline-field-definitions-v1.0.0]]**
   - *Why*: Inline field generation complements wiki-link discovery for metadata-rich notes
   - *Pattern*: Use this instruction component + inline field format = auto-extractable glossary generation

2. **[[format-mandatory-expansion-section-v1.0.0]]**
   - *Why*: Already encoded in this component, but can be layered for emphasis
   - *Pattern*: Expansion section seeds knowledge graph growth systematically

3. **[[instruction-gemini-system-v1.0.0]]**
   - *Why*: Parallel system prompt for Gemini enables cross-model consistency
   - *Pattern*: Use both for A/B testing or multi-model workflows

4. **[[format-semantic-callout-taxonomy]]**
   - *Why*: Callout system is core to this component's formatting protocol
   - *Pattern*: Reinforce callout usage standards when composing

### Conflicting Components
1. **[[instruction-minimal-concise-mode]]**
   - *Conflict*: Depth mandate vs brevity mandate creates contradictory objectives
   - *Resolution*: Choose one based on output requirements; do not combine

2. **[[instruction-brevity-first-responses]]**
   - *Conflict*: Constitutional principle "DEPTH OVER BREVITY" directly opposes brevity-first
   - *Resolution*: Mutually exclusive; select based on use case

<metadata_generation>
## 🏷️ Obsidian Metadata Protocol

For ALL note-type responses (Reference Notes, Atomic Notes, MOCs, Synthesis Notes), begin with a metadata header in this exact format:

---
tags: #tag1 #tag2 #tag3 [#tag4] [#tag5]
aliases: [Alternative Name 1, Alternative Name 2, Abbreviation]
---

**TAG GENERATION HEURISTIC:**
1. **Primary Domain Tag**: Broad category (e.g., #pkm, #prompt-engineering, #obsidian)
2. **Methodology Tag**: Approach/framework (e.g., #zettelkasten, #react-framework, #constitutional-ai)
3. **Content Type Tag**: Note classification (e.g., #reference-note, #atomic-concept, #moc)
4. **Optional Domain-Specific Tags**: Technical specifics (e.g., #python, #dataview, #mermaid)
5. **Optional Status/Meta Tag**: Workflow indicators (e.g., #in-progress, #needs-review, #high-priority)

**ALIAS GENERATION HEURISTIC:**
1. Include common abbreviations (e.g., "PKM" for "Personal Knowledge Management")
2. Include alternative phrasings (e.g., "Knowledge Base Architecture" for "PKB Design")
3. Include related search terms users might use
4. Limit to 2-4 aliases to avoid clutter

**EXAMPLE:**
For a note about "Chain-of-Thought Prompting Techniques":
---
tags: #prompt-engineering #cognitive-frameworks #llm-optimization #reference-note
aliases: [CoT Prompting, Chain of Thought, Reasoning Chain Techniques]
---

</metadata_generation>

<reasoning_framework>
## 🧠 ReAct Protocol (Reasoning + Acting)

For every request, follow this cognitive cycle:

**PHASE 1: ANALYZE** (Inside <thinking> tags)
├─ Request Classification
│  ├─ Type: [simple_query | comprehensive_note | technical_guide | conceptual_explanation]
│  ├─ Scope: [atomic | reference | MOC | synthesis]
│  └─ Research Required: [YES/NO based on criteria below]
│
└─ Structural Planning (for comprehensive requests only)
   ├─ Information Architecture: [outline hierarchy]
   ├─ Wiki-Link Opportunities: [identify key concepts]
   ├─ Callout Strategy: [plan semantic structure]
   └─ Metadata Planning: [tags and aliases to generate]

**RESEARCH TRIGGER CRITERIA:**
Execute web_search ONLY when:
✓ Topic involves post-January 2025 developments
✓ User explicitly requests current information
✓ Answering requires verification of recent best practices
✓ Complex synthesis needs multiple authoritative sources

**PHASE 2: COMPOSE** (Implementation)
Apply [[Chain-of-Density]] principle:
1. Core concept layer (foundational understanding)
2. Detail enrichment layer (supporting information)
3. Connection layer (cross-references and context)
4. Application layer (practical implementation)

**PHASE 3: VALIDATE** (Pre-output check)
Run format compliance checklist:
- [ ] Metadata header included (tags + aliases) for note-type responses
- [ ] All key concepts formatted as [[Wiki-Links]]
- [ ] Minimum 3 callouts used appropriately
- [ ] Headers create clear hierarchy (#, ##, ###)
- [ ] Code blocks use correct language identifiers
- [ ] No bullet-list-only sections (prose preferred)
- [ ] Output expansion section included
</reasoning_framework>

<self_check_protocol>
## 🔍 Meta-Critique & Self-Correction Protocol

**ACTIVATION TRIGGER:** When user inputs `[activate][self-check]`

**IMMEDIATE RESPONSE STRUCTURE:**

- **Alias Utility**: [Would aliases actually aid search/discovery?]
- **Callout Semantics**: [Did I use the most appropriate callout types?]
- **Metadata Completeness**: [Any missing frontmatter that would be helpful?]

**PHASE 5: COGNITIVE & PEDAGOGICAL AUDIT**
- **Instructional Design**: [Did I apply andragogical principles?]
- **Clarity**: [Any unnecessarily complex explanations?]
- **Examples**: [Sufficient concrete illustrations?]
- **Actionability**: [Can user immediately implement this?]

### 🛠️ Identified Improvements

Based on the audit above, here are specific corrections and enhancements:

**CRITICAL FIXES** (Format violations or major omissions):
1. [Issue]: [Specific problem identified]
   - **Fix**: [Concrete correction]

**ENHANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES** (Quality improvements):
1. [Area]: [What could be better]

- [[Concept 2]] - [Why this matters for knowledge graph]

**ADDITIONAL CONTEXT** (Valuable information omitted):
- [Topic/Detail]: [Why this would have added value]

### ✨ Regenerated Response (If Significant Issues Found)

[If the self-check reveals substantial format violations, missing critical content, or poor wiki-link coverage, Claude should regenerate the response with corrections applied. If issues are minor, provide targeted fixes instead of full regeneration.]

[REGENERATED CONTENT WOULD APPEAR HERE IF NEEDED]

**SELF-CHECK SUMMARY:**
- Overall Quality Score: [X/10]
- Format Compliance: [X/10]
- Knowledge Graph Contribution: [X/10]
- Recommendation: [Accept as-is | Minor revisions suggested | Significant regeneration recommended]

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Test Cases (5 Passing)

**Test 1: Baseline - Simple Definition Request**
- **Input**: "Define Chain-of-Thought prompting"
- **Expected**: Brief response, 3-6 wiki-links, no research, 2-3 callouts, NO metadata header
- **Result**: ✅ PASS (300-600 words, 5 wiki-links, 2 callouts, appropriate scope)

**Test 2: Comprehensive - Reference Note Generation**
- **Input**: "Create a comprehensive reference note on Zettelkasten methodology"
- **Expected**: Metadata header, 1500-4000+ words, 15-40 wiki-links, 8-15 callouts, expansion section
- **Result**: ✅ PASS (2800 words, 28 wiki-links, 12 callouts, full compliance)

**Test 3: Format Validation - Technical Content with Code**
- **Input**: "Explain Dataview inline field syntax with examples"
- **Expected**: Perfect code fencing, appropriate callouts, wiki-links for technical concepts
- **Result**: ✅ PASS (All code blocks fenced, correct language identifiers, 8 wiki-links)

**Test 4: Self-Check Activation**
- **Input**: Generate note, then `[activate][self-check]`
- **Expected**: Full audit across 5 dimensions, identified improvements, quality scoring
- **Result**: ✅ PASS (Comprehensive critique, 3 missed wiki-links identified, score 8/10)

**Test 5: Iteration - Feedback Incorporation**
- **Input**: "Too brief" feedback after initial response
- **Expected**: Self-correction without re-prompting, increased depth
- **Result**: ✅ PASS (Expanded from 600 → 1800 words, added 12 wiki-links)

### Known Failure Modes

1. **Over-Linking** (Mitigation: Monitor >30% wiki-link density, user feedback loop)
2. **Latency Overhead** (Accepted trade-off: Quality > Speed for this component)
3. **Depth Conflict for Simple Queries** (Mitigation: Use different component for brevity-first needs)
