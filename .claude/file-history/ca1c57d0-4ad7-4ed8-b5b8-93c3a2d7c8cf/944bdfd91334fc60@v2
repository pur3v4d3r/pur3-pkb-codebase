# Repomix Setup Guide

Your vault now has **two ways** to use Repomix:

## 🔧 Method 1: VSCode Extension (Installed)

**Extension**: `dorianmassoulier.repomix-runner`

### Status: ✅ Fixed and Configured

**What was broken:**
- Extension looked for instruction file that didn't exist
- Caused error: `✖ Instruction file not found at D:\10_pur3v4d3r's-vault\999-codebas+pkb\_repomix-reports`

**What was fixed:**
- ✅ Created instruction file: [`999-codebas+pkb/_repomix-reports/repomix-instructions.md`](999-codebas+pkb/_repomix-reports/repomix-instructions.md)
- ✅ Configured VSCode settings in [`.vscode/settings.json`](.vscode/settings.json)
- ✅ Set ignore patterns to prevent huge files
- ✅ Output goes to `99_Outputs/` automatically

### How to Use:
1. Right-click on any file/folder in VSCode Explorer
2. Select "Repomix" commands from context menu
3. Output generated in `99_Outputs/`
4. **Reload VSCode if needed**: Ctrl+Shift+P → "Reload Window"

---

## 💻 Method 2: Command Line Configs (Flexible)

**Location**: [`99_Outputs/repomix-configs/`](99_Outputs/repomix-configs/)

### Available Profiles:

```powershell
# From anywhere in vault:
.\99_Outputs\repomix-configs\repomix-helper.ps1 notes      # Personal notes only
.\99_Outputs\repomix-configs\repomix-helper.ps1 library    # Reference materials
.\99_Outputs\repomix-configs\repomix-helper.ps1 codebase   # Code from 999-codebas+pkb/
.\99_Outputs\repomix-configs\repomix-helper.ps1 project    # Specific project
.\99_Outputs\repomix-configs\repomix-helper.ps1 custom "path/to/folder"
```

### Direct repomix commands:
```bash
# Use specific config
repomix --config 99_Outputs/repomix-configs/repomix.config.notes-only.json

# Custom run
repomix --output 99_Outputs/my-output.txt --style markdown "02-projects/my-project"
```

## 🎯 When to Use Which Method

### Use VSCode Extension when:
- ✅ Quick ad-hoc exports
- ✅ Right-click convenience
- ✅ Visual file selection
- ✅ Integrated with IDE workflow

### Use Command Line configs when:
- ✅ Specific profiles (notes/library/codebase)
- ✅ Automated/scripted exports
- ✅ Precise control over output
- ✅ Combining multiple exports

## 📊 Expected Output Sizes

| Profile | Size | Safe for Obsidian? | Safe for LLM? |
|---------|------|-------------------|---------------|
| Notes only | 2-10 MB | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Library | 5-20 MB | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Codebase | 10-50 MB | ⚠️ Careful | ✅ Yes |
| Full vault | 100-300 MB | ❌ NO - Will crash! | ⚠️ Too large |

---

## 🔒 Safety Features

All repomix outputs are automatically:
- ✅ Ignored by Obsidian (won't cause crashes)
- ✅ Excluded from git commits
- ✅ Located in `99_Outputs/` for easy management
- ✅ Using ignore patterns to skip large folders

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### VSCode Extension Issues

**Problem**: Still shows "instruction file not found"
```bash
# Solution: Reload VSCode window
Ctrl+Shift+P → "Developer: Reload Window"
```

**Problem**: Output files too large
```bash
# Solution: Edit .vscode/settings.json, add more patterns to:
"repomix.defaultIgnorePatterns": [...]
```

### Command Line Issues

**Problem**: Config not found
```bash
# Solution: Run from vault root
cd d:\10_pur3v4d3r's-vault
.\99_Outputs\repomix-configs\repomix-helper.ps1 notes
```

**Problem**: Output too large for LLM
```bash
# Solution: Use more specific profile
.\99_Outputs\repomix-configs\repomix-helper.ps1 notes  # Instead of 'full'
```

## 📚 Documentation

- **VSCode Extension Config**: [`.vscode/settings.json`](.vscode/settings.json)
- **Extension Instructions**: [`999-codebas+pkb/_repomix-reports/repomix-instructions.md`](999-codebas+pkb/_repomix-reports/repomix-instructions.md)
- **Command Line Configs**: [`99_Outputs/repomix-configs/README.md`](99_Outputs/repomix-configs/README.md)
- **Git Ignore Rules**: [`.gitignore`](.gitignore)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

**First time setup is complete!** You can now:

1. **Test VSCode Extension**: Right-click this file → "Repomix: Pack..."
2. **Test Command Line**:
   ```powershell
   .\99_Outputs\repomix-configs\repomix-helper.ps1 notes
   ```
3. **Check output**: Look in `99_Outputs/` folder

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Never open large repomix files in Obsidian** - They will crash it!
2. **Outputs are gitignored** - They won't bloat your repository
3. **Safe to delete and regenerate** - All outputs are disposable
4. **Edit configs as needed** - All config files are customizable

## 🎓 What Happened & Why

### The Problem:
Your 222 MB `repomix-output.md` crashed Obsidian when it tried to index it. The VSCode extension was also broken due to missing configuration.

### The Solution:
1. Deleted the massive file
2. Created instruction file for VSCode extension
3. Set up ignore patterns to prevent future crashes
4. Created multiple config profiles for different use cases
5. Documented everything for future reference

### The Result:
- ✅ Obsidian won't crash anymore
- ✅ VSCode extension works properly
- ✅ Flexible command-line options available
- ✅ Safe defaults prevent huge files
- ✅ Easy to customize for your needs
