## 📊 LIBRARY OVERVIEW

```dataviewjs
// Component Statistics
const atomics = dv.pages('"02-projects/_spes-sequential-prompt-engineering-system/02-component-library/atomic"')
    .where(p => p.type === "component");
const composites = dv.pages('"02-projects/_spes-sequential-prompt-engineering-system/02-component-library/composite"')
    .where(p => p.type === "component");
const specialized = dv.pages('"02-projects/_spes-sequential-prompt-engineering-system/02-component-library/specialized"')
    .where(p => p.type === "component");

const total = atomics.length + composites.length + specialized.length;

dv.header(3, "📈 Library Statistics");
dv.paragraph(`**Total Components**: ${total}`);
dv.paragraph(`- **Atomic**: ${atomics.length} (single-purpose building blocks)`);
dv.paragraph(`- **Composite**: ${composites.length} (multi-component patterns)`);
dv.paragraph(`- **Specialized**: ${specialized.length} (domain-specific templates)`);

## 🔍 SEARCH PATTERNS

### Find by Keyword
Use Obsidian search: `path:"02-component-library" keyword`

### Find by Tag
```dataview
LIST
FROM #component-type/persona
```

### Find Synergies
Look for components with `synergies-with` links to discover proven combinations.

### Find Conflicts
Check `conflicts-with` arrays to avoid problematic combinations.

## 🆕 ADDING NEW COMPONENTS

### Quick Add (QuickAdd Macro)
1. `Ctrl+P` → "QuickAdd: Component Quick Create"
2. Answer guided questions
3. Component created with proper metadata

### From Template
1. Use `_component-template.md`
2. Fill in metadata and component text
3. Move to appropriate subfolder (atomic/composite/specialized)
4. Add to this index via query (automatic)

### Component Checklist
- [ ] Use component template
- [ ] Specify component-type, atomic-composite, domain
- [ ] Write clear "When to Use" and "When NOT to Use" sections
- [ ] Provide at least one usage example
- [ ] Test in multiple contexts
- [ ] Document any conflicts or synergies discovered
- [ ] Add to appropriate subfolder

## 🔧 MAINTENANCE

### Components Needing Review

```dataview
TABLE last-used, usage-count, rating
FROM "02-projects/_spes-sequential-prompt-engineering-system/02-component-library"
WHERE type = "component" AND usage-count = 0 AND datediff(date(today), date(created), "day") > 90
SORT created ASC
```

### Low-Rated Components

```dataview
TABLE rating, usage-count, domain
FROM "02-projects/_spes-sequential-prompt-engineering-system/02-component-library"
WHERE type = "component" AND rating > 0 AND rating < 5
SORT rating ASC
```

### Orphaned Components (No Usage)

```dataview
TABLE created, domain, component-type
FROM "02-projects/_spes-sequential-prompt-engineering-system/02-component-library"
WHERE type = "component" AND usage-count = 0
SORT created ASC
LIMIT 20
```

## 📚 LEARNING RESOURCES

### Component Design Principles
1. **Atomic First**: Break complex ideas into smallest reusable units
2. **Single Purpose**: Each component does one thing well
3. **Clear Boundaries**: Document when to use and when NOT to use
4. **Test Multiple Contexts**: Verify reusability across domains
5. **Track Performance**: Monitor usage and quality scores

### Composition Patterns
- **Sequential Chains**: Persona → Context → Instruction → Constraint → Format
- **Layered Enhancement**: Start general, add specificity incrementally
- **Domain Adaptation**: General component + domain context = specialized variant

### Best Practices
- Name components descriptively (action-oriented for instructions, role-based for personas)
- Include examples showing component in full prompt context
- Document discovered synergies and conflicts promptly
- Update performance scores after significant usage
- Archive unused components after 6 months (move to `99-archive`)
