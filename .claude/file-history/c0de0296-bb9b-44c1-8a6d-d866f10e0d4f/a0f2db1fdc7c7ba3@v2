# Repomix Reports & Instructions

This folder is used by the **Repomix Runner VSCode extension** (`dorianmassoulier.repomix-runner`).

## What Was Wrong

The VSCode extension was looking for an instruction file at this path but it didn't exist, causing errors:
```
✖ Instruction file not found at D:\10_pur3v4d3r's-vault\999-codebas+pkb\_repomix-reports
```

## What Was Fixed

1. ✅ Created this directory
2. ✅ Added `repomix-instructions.md` - instruction file for the extension
3. ✅ Updated `.vscode/settings.json` with proper repomix configuration

## Files in This Folder

### `repomix-instructions.md`
Context and guidelines for AI processing of this vault. The VSCode extension uses this when generating repomix outputs.

### `.gitkeep`
Keeps this folder in git even when empty.

## VSCode Extension Settings

Location: `.vscode/settings.json`

```json
{
  "repomix.instructionFilePath": "999-codebas+pkb/_repomix-reports/repomix-instructions.md",
  "repomix.defaultOutputPath": "99_Outputs",
  "repomix.defaultIgnorePatterns": [
    "**/.obsidian/**",
    "**/node_modules/**",
    "**/99-archive/**",
    "**/__LOCAL-REPO/**",
    "**/99_Outputs/repomix-*.md",
    "**/99_Outputs/repomix-*.xml",
    "**/99_Outputs/repomix-*.txt",
    "**/*.log",
    "**/.git/**"
  ]
}
```

## Using the VSCode Extension

Now that it's configured, you can:

1. **Right-click** on files/folders in VSCode Explorer
2. Select **"Repomix: Pack Selected Files"** or similar command
3. Output will go to `99_Outputs/` by default
4. Files will respect the ignore patterns

## Alternative: Command Line Configs

For more control, use the command-line configs in:
`99_Outputs/repomix-configs/`

These give you profiles like:
- `notes` - Personal notes only
- `library` - Reference materials
- `codebase` - Code files
- `custom` - Specific paths

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Extension still shows errors
- **Solution**: Reload VSCode window (Ctrl+Shift+P → "Reload Window")

**Problem**: Files too large
- **Solution**: Add more patterns to `repomix.defaultIgnorePatterns` in settings.json

**Problem**: Want different instruction file
- **Solution**: Edit path in `.vscode/settings.json` and create new instruction file
