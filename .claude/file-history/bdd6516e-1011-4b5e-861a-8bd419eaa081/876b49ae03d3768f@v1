# Session Memory

> [!abstract] Purpose
> This note maintains persistent context across Claude sessions, enabling continuity in knowledge management tasks and vault operations.

## 🔄 Current Session (2025-12-16)

### Active Tasks
- **Memory System Implementation**: Created the 00-meta directory structure for persistent session tracking
- **System Enhancement**: Implementing context persistence to avoid session amnesia
- **Vault Scan Tool Integration**: Fixed and documented `_scripts/vault_scan.py` for anti-duplication protocol
- **Self-Documenting Dataview System**: Adapting self-documenting dataview system for general PKB knowledge work

### Session Notes

- User reported previous session hung for 20+ minutes on `.clauderc` discussion
- Implementing Option 3: Context Files approach (vault-integrated memory vs isolated config)
- User prefers direct, efficient communication without filler
- Fixed nested directory structure in `_scripts/vault_scan.py` (was incorrectly nested as folder)
- **New Project**: Self-documenting dataview system adaptation for PKB knowledge work

## 📝 Session History Log

### 2025-12-16

#### Morning Session

- **Event**: Memory system initialization
- **Action**: Created 00-meta infrastructure
- **Outcome**: Established persistent context framework

#### Vault Scan Tool Integration

- **Event**: User added `_scripts/vault_scan.py` for anti-duplication enforcement
- **Action**: Fixed nested directory structure (`vault_scan.py` folder → `vault_scan.py` file)
- **Tool Purpose**: Scans vault for exact filename matches, alias matches, and fuzzy suggestions before note creation
- **Usage**: `vscan "search term"` (wrapper: `vscan.bat`)
- **Test Results**: ✅ Exact match detection, ✅ Fuzzy matching, ✅ Unique term detection
- **Status**: Production ready

#### Orphan Detection System

- **Event**: Created `_scripts/orphan_check.py` for graph health monitoring
- **Purpose**: Identifies notes with insufficient connections (Protocol: "≥2 incoming + ≥2 outgoing links")
- **Usage**: `orphan` (wrapper: `orphan.bat`)
- **Initial Scan Results**:
  - Total notes: 3,098
  - Healthy: 341 (11.0%)
  - Completely isolated: 1,583 (51.1%)
  - Weak outgoing: 675 notes
  - Weak incoming: 1,027 notes
- **Status**: Production ready, reveals significant graph debt

#### Broken Link Detection System

- **Event**: Created `_scripts/link_check.py` for link integrity monitoring
- **Purpose**: Identifies broken [[Wiki-Links]] (Protocol: "NO broken links")
- **Usage**: `linkcheck` (wrapper: `linkcheck.bat`)
- **Initial Scan Results**:
  - Total wiki-links: 41,688
  - Broken links: 30,966 (74.3%)
  - Files affected: 1,790
  - Ghost links (intentional): 4
- **Key Patterns Identified**:
  - Documentation exemplars contain example links (not real breaks)
  - Template variables (`${page.file.name}`, Templater syntax) flagged as broken
  - Periodic note links (`[[2025-W49]]`) may be intentional missing notes
  - Strategic research docs contain placeholder links for future concepts
- **Status**: Production ready, needs refinement for false positives

#### Metadata Compliance Audit System

- **Event**: Created `_scripts/meta_audit.py` for 5-Tag System enforcement
- **Purpose**: Validates YAML frontmatter compliance (Protocol: tags, aliases, status, certainty)
- **Usage**: `metaudit` (wrapper: `metaudit.bat`)
- **Initial Scan Results**:
  - Total notes: 3,395
  - Fully compliant: 4 (0.1%)
  - No frontmatter: 1,240 (36.5%)
  - Missing status: 1,208 files
  - Missing certainty: 2,147 files
  - Invalid status values: 846 files (using `active` instead of seedling/evergreen/reference)
- **Status**: Production ready, reveals critical metadata standardization need

#### Self-Documenting Dataview System Adaptation

- **Event**: User requested adaptation of self-documenting dataview system for general PKB knowledge work
- **Action**: Comprehensive vault analysis and system design
- **Analysis Completed**:
  - Vault structure mapping (8 primary folders, 4 knowledge domains identified)
  - Existing metadata schema analysis (sophisticated multi-field system already in place)
  - Sample note examination (permanent notes, library references, project notes)
  - Identified user's manual `link-related` maintenance as automation opportunity
- **Deliverable Created**: `02-projects/-ongoing-project-pur3v4d3r/_self-documenting-dataview/pur3v4d3r-self-documenting-pkb-system.md`
- **System Design Features**:
  - Enhancement strategy (preserves existing schema, adds auto-discovery)
  - New metadata fields: `concepts::`, `methodologies::`, `tools::`, `fields::`, `people::`
  - 3 production-ready templates (concept notes, application notes, library references)
  - 2 dashboard queries (concept network, field/domain intelligence)
  - Integration with existing review system and maturity tracking
  - Crash-safe queries (learned from original system issues)
- **Domains Identified**:
  - Cognitive Development (`01_cognitive-development`)
  - Personal Knowledge Base (`02_personal-knowledge-base`)
  - Prompt Engineering (`04_prompt-engineering`)
  - Cosmology (`03_cosmology`)
- **Status**: Design complete, ready for implementation phase

#### Post-Cleanup Vault Health Scan (After Exemplar Removal)

- **Event**: User removed documentation exemplars and test files
- **Action**: Re-ran all three diagnostic tools (orphan, linkcheck, metaudit)
- **Results Summary**:

**Orphan Detection (Post-Cleanup):**
  - Total notes: 1,502 (from 3,098, -51.5%)
  - Healthy: 281 (18.7%, up from 11.0%) ✅
  - Completely isolated: 389 (25.9%, down from 51.1%) ✅
  - Weak outgoing: 444 notes
  - Weak incoming: 763 notes
  - **Impact**: Significant improvement in graph health percentage

**Link Integrity (Post-Cleanup):**
  - Total wiki-links: 29,414 (from 41,688, -29.4%)
  - Broken links: 22,391 (76.1%, slightly up from 74.3%)
  - Files affected: 946 (from 1,790, -47.2%) ✅
  - **Key Remaining Issues**:
    - Periodic note links (`[[2025-W49]]`, `[[2025-12]]`, `[[2025-Q4]]`) - 657 breaks in one file
    - Strategic expansion plans with placeholder concepts (421 breaks)
    - Historical scratchpads with old references (336 breaks)
  - **Impact**: Removed most false positives, reveals genuine structural issues

**Metadata Compliance (Post-Cleanup):**
  - Total notes: 1,549 (from 3,395, -54.4%)
  - Fully compliant: 4 (0.3%, minimal improvement from 0.1%)
  - No frontmatter: 336 (21.7%, down from 36.5%) ✅
  - Missing certainty: 1,205 files (still critical)
  - Missing status: 355 files
  - Invalid status values: 773 files (still using `active`/`⚡active`)
  - **Impact**: Reduced absolute numbers, but compliance percentage remains critical

- **Status**: Baseline established, ready for systematic remediation
