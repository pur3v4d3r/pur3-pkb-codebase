> [!key] **to Autonomy in the PKB**
> 1. I shouldn't be afraid of having *misc. Items unfinished or in-progress* throughout the **PKB**. These "Items" **DO NOT** represent bad things or negative concepts to avoid. Instead, *these are avenues for the future self to explore* and get lost in the enticing nature that is knowledge work. When I fret over these unfinished items or tell myself that "*I must do X*" or "*I must do Y*" **I'm being nonautonomous**, **this risks losing the work we've started**.

> 2. In order **to be successfully autonomous** you need to *stop* with making yourself feel bad or guilt ridden over having to many active projects, open work assignment, or tasks to-do, etc. Yes they **DO ADD** to [[Cognitive Load]], however *if managed appropriately through* [[Extended Mind]] theory or [[External-Cognition]].

> "True autonomy in a knowledge system is supported by what Nassim Taleb calls the **Anti-Library**. The unread books and open loops in our system should not represent a backlog of guilt (which thwarts autonomy) but a horizon of possibility (which supports autonomy). We must design our systems to allow for **Serendipitous Drift**—the freedom to abandon a book that is boring, the freedom to fall down a rabbit hole that has no immediate economic value. When the user feels that they are the master of the system, rather than the servant of its maintenance requirements, autonomy is satisfied."
