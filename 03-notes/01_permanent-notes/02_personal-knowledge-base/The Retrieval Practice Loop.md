**Reinforcing Loop 2: The Retrieval Practice Loop**

A second reinforcing loop operates through the mechanism of **[[Retrieval Practice|retrieval]]**. In cognitive science, the "testing effect" demonstrates that the act of *recalling* information strengthens memory more powerfully than passive review. Every time you search your PKB for a relevant note—whether to answer a question, support an argument, or make a decision—you are engaging in retrieval practice. Successful retrieval strengthens the neural pathways associated with that note, making it *easier* to retrieve in the future. But here's where the loop closes: the *easier* it is to retrieve a note, the *more often* you will retrieve it, which strengthens it further. Over time, certain notes become "evergreen"—they appear again and again in your thinking, not because you consciously decided to privilege them, but because the loop has made them highly accessible.

The causal chain: **Retrieve a Note** → **Strengthen Memory of That Note** → **Easier to Retrieve in Future** → **Retrieve More Often**. This loop explains why a well-used PKB develops a kind of "personality"—certain ideas become central to your thinking not by fiat, but through organic, repeated use.
