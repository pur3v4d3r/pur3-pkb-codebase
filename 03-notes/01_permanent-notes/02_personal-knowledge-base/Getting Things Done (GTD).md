# Getting Things Done (GTD)

> [!definition]
> - **Key-Term**:: [[Getting Things Done (GTD)]]
> - [**Definition**:: A personal productivity system developed by David Allen that moves all items of interest, information, issues, tasks, and projects out of one's mind by recording them externally, then breaking them into actionable work items with known time limits.]

> [!key-claim]
>  **GTD's Cognitive Liberation**
> The fundamental promise of GTD is stress reduction through complete externalization. When your "reminder system" is external and trusted, your mind stops repeatedly surfacing incomplete commitments, allowing genuine focus on current tasks. GTD can be understood as an application of [[Distributed Cognition]] or [[Extended Mind]] theory.

> [!use-cases-and-examples]
> # **PKB Application of GTD**
> 
> **Traditional GTD**: "Write quarterly report" → "Draft outline for Q3 metrics" (@computer, 30min)
> 
> **Knowledge Work GTD**: "Master retrieval practice techniques" → 
> - Project: [[Retrieval Practice]] mastery
> - Next Actions: 
>   - "Read Chapter 3 of 'Make It Stick'" (@reading-chair, 45min, med-energy)
>   - "Create 10 flashcards on spacing effects" (@computer, 20min, low-energy)
>   - "Write synthesis note connecting spacing to my calculus studying" (@computer, 60min, high-energy)

> [!evidence]
> # The Five-Phase GTD Workflow
> 
> GTD operates through five sequential stages that transform inputs into completed actions:
> 
> **1. Capture** 
> - Collect everything demanding attention into inbox systems
> - Zero cognitive overhead during capture—no evaluation yet
> - Multiple capture points (physical inbox, digital capture tools, voice memos)
> 
> **2. Clarify** 
> - Process each item: "What is it?" and "Is it actionable?"
> - If actionable and <2 minutes → do immediately
> - If actionable and longer → delegate, defer, or project
> - If not actionable → trash, someday/maybe, or reference
> 
> **3. Organize**
> Sort tasks into context-based categories:
> - **Context**: Tools/location needed (@computer, @phone, @office)
> - **Project**: Grouped by desired outcome
> - **Priority**: Based on importance and deadlines
> - **Time Available**: Quick tasks vs. deep work blocks
> - **Energy Available**: Cognitive demand matching
> 
> **4. Reflect** (Weekly Review)
> - Review all projects and active lists
> - Process new inputs accumulated during week
> - Update project plans and next actions
> - Ensure system remains current and trustworthy
> 
> **5. Engage**
> Select next action based on four criteria:
> 1. Context (where you are)
> 2. Time available
> 3. Energy available  
> 4. Priority
