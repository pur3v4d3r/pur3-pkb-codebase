# Time Blocking

> [!definition]
> - **Key-Term**:: [[03-notes/01_permanent-notes/02_personal-knowledge-base/Time Blocking]]
> - **Definition**:: A time management method where specific time blocks with defined start and end times are allocated to individual tasks or categories of work, creating a proactive schedule that protects focused work periods.

> [!evidence]
> ## Time Blocking Core Principles
> 
> Time blocking's effectiveness stems from several cognitive principles:
> 
> 1. **Proactive vs. Reactive Scheduling**: Intentional time allocation prevents reactive firefighting
> 2. **Context Preservation**: Reduced task-switching preserves cognitive momentum
> 3. **Flow State Access**: 90-minute deep work blocks enable entry into flow states, characterized by complete immersion and enhanced productivity
> 4. **Realistic Capacity Planning**: Visual time representation reveals actual available capacity
> 
> ### Time Blocking Framework
> 
> Effective time blocking follows this systematic approach:
> 
> **Weekly Planning**
> 1. Review goals and projects in task manager
> 2. Identify high-priority outcomes for the week
> 3. Schedule non-negotiable commitments (meetings, appointments)
> 4. Block time for highest-priority goal work
> 5. Create buffers for unexpected interruptions
> 
> **Daily Refinement**
> 6. Morning review of time blocks
> 7. Adjustment based on energy levels and emerging priorities
> 8. Notification reminders as blocks approach
> 9. End-of-day review and next-day blocking
> 

> [!helpful-tip]
> **The 80/20 Blocking Rule**
> Schedule only 80% of available time in blocks, leaving 20% as buffer for unexpected issues, interruptions, and cognitive rest. Over-scheduling creates rigidity that collapses when reality intervenes.
