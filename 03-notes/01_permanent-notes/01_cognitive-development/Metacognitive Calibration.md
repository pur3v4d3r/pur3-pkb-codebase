> [!definition]
> **[[Metacognitive Calibration]]:**
> - **Definition**: The degree of correspondence between one's **subjective confidence** in their *cognitive performance* and their **actual**, *objective performance*. Perfect calibration means confidence ratings **precisely** match *actual accuracy*. Miscalibration can manifest as [[overconfidence]] (inflated self-assessment) or [[underconfidence]] (deflated self-assessment), both of which impair learning efficiency by leading to suboptimal strategy selection and resource allocation.[^1]
> - The accuracy with which an individual's subjective confidence judgments correspond to their objective performance. Perfect calibration means one's confidence ratings precisely predict accuracy—if I'm 70% confident in an answer, I should be correct 70% of the time across many such judgments. Miscalibration can manifest as systematic overconfidence (inflated self-assessment relative to actual performance) or underconfidence (deflated self-assessment). *Calibration* is measured by comparing confidence ratings against actual performance outcomes and computing the degree of correspondence. **Well-calibrated** individuals can accurately assess their own knowledge states, enabling efficient resource allocation (studying what they don't know while bypassing what they've mastered). **Poor calibration** leads to inefficient learning because study time is misallocated—*overconfident* individuals stop studying prematurely, while *underconfident* individuals waste time on already-mastered material. Importantly, calibration is a metacognitive skill distinct from first-order cognitive ability: one can be highly intelligent but poorly calibrated, or conversely, have modest cognitive abilities but excellent calibration. Educational interventions can improve calibration through practice with confidence-accuracy feedback, teaching students to use diagnostic cues indicating understanding level, and cultivating *epistemic humility* about the limits of one's knowledge.

[^1]: This Connects strongly with [[Illusions Of Comprehension]] in that they all inhibit your ability to perform [[Metacognitive Calibration]].
