> [!definition]
> - **Key-Term**:[[Schemas]]
> - [**Definition**:Knowledge is organized into cognitive structures (schemata) representing concepts and their relationships. Learning involves modifying existing schemata through two processes: assimilation (integrating new information into existing frameworks) and accommodation (restructuring frameworks to incorporate incompatible information).]

[[Schemas]] are structures found in [[Long-Term Memory]] that allow an individual to store vast amounts of domain specific knowledge as individual single units through [[Chunking|chunking]], or similar methods. An individual may pull that information as needed into the [[Focus Of Attention]]. Without taking up more than one space in the [[Cognitive Load Theory]] inventory. (*7 plus or minus 2*, *4*) 

The process of [[Schemas]] formation can occur through a variety of ways, including:
1. Repeated use of that [[Working Memory]].
2. Closeness over time
3. Interconnectedness with other Ideas
4. Meaningfulness

As you first begin to develop a new [[Schemas]] the onset will appear difficult as the [[Cognitive Load Theory|cognitive load]] placed upon your limited [[Working Memory]] will be at an all-time high, thus cause the side effects attributed with [[Cognitive Load Theory]].

> [!core-principle]
> **Schemas as the Bridge Between Capacity and Capability**
> 
> The mechanism by which working memory's severe limitations are transcended in expertise development is through the construction and automation of [[Schemas|schemas]]—organized knowledge structures in [[Long-Term Memory]] that can be retrieved and applied as single units in working memory, despite encompassing vast amounts of lower-level information. A chess master's working memory is not larger than a novice's; rather, through years of deliberate practice, the master has constructed thousands of chess-specific schemas that allow entire board configurations to be perceived as single meaningful units. The goal of all learning, from this perspective, is the construction of an ever-more-elaborate library of automated schemas that transform effortful, capacity-consuming processes into fluent, automatic operations that impose minimal load on working memory.
