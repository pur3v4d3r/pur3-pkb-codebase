> [!definition]
> - **Key-Term**:[[Working Memory]]
> - [**Definition**:Occupies a unique position in human cognitive architecture, serving simultaneously as the workspace where conscious thought occurs and as the obligatory gateway through which all new learning must pass. Limited capacity, temporary storage.
> 	- [[Working Memory]] Consists of active portions of [[Long-Term Memory]].
> 	- [[Working Memory]] is like a metal scratchpad for you active thoughts.]
> 
> - **Capacity Limits**:Typically 4±1 "chunks" of information can be actively maintained simultaneously
> - **Duration**:Information fades from working memory within 10-20 seconds without rehearsal

> [!evidence]
> **Components of Working Memory** (Baddeley's Model):
> - **Phonological Loop**: Processes verbal and auditory information (inner speech)
> - **Visuospatial Sketchpad**: Handles visual and spatial information (mental imagery)
> - **Episodic Buffer**: Integrates information from different modalities with [[Long-Term Memory]]
> - **Central Executive**: Directs attention and coordinates the other components

**2. [[Working Memory (Executive Aspect)**
- Updating mental representations as new information arrives
- Manipulating information held in consciousness
- Integrating multiple streams of information
- *Application*: Critical for complex reasoning, problem-solving, and connecting new knowledge to existing [[Schemas|schemas]]

> [!connections-and-links]
> - The relationship with [[Long-Term Working Memory]] is crucial: Experts develop sophisticated [[Schemas|schemas]] that allow them to [[Chunking|chunk]] information efficiently, effectively expanding [[Working Memory]] capacity within their domain of expertise.

> [!connection-ideas]
> **The Cognitive Load Relationship**
> Planning reduces [[Working Memory]] burden by creating external cognitive scaffolds. Dav
> id Allen's [[GTD]] methodology explicitly addresses this: "There is an inverse relationship between things on your mind and those things getting done." When planning systems externalize commitments, they free working memory for higher-order cognitive tasks rather than mere recall.
