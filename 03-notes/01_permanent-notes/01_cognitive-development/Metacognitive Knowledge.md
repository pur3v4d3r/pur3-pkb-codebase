> [[Metacognitive Knowledge]]
> - **Definition**: The "database" of what an individual *knows* about their own cognitive system. It is composed of three categories: **Person Knowledge** (one's own strengths, weaknesses, and biases), **Task Knowledge** (the demands and nature of different mental tasks), and **Strategy Knowledge** (a "toolbox" of cognitive strategies and when to use them).

# Metacognitive Knowledge: The Declarative Foundation

**[[Metacognitive Knowledge]]** encompasses everything one knows about cognitive processes—*how memory works*, *which strategies facilitate learning*, *when different approaches prove effective*, *how one's own cognitive strengths and limitations compare to others*. Flavell's original taxonomy organized this knowledge into three categories that remain definitive:

**Person variables** comprise knowledge about oneself and others as cognitive processors. This includes understanding that memory has limits, recognizing that some people excel at verbal reasoning while others excel at spatial reasoning, and knowing one's own cognitive profile. Research demonstrates that accurate person knowledge correlates with academic achievement—students who correctly assess their strengths and weaknesses select more appropriate strategies and invest effort more efficiently. However, calibration research reveals systematic metacognitive biases: the [[Dunning-Kruger Effect]] shows how those with least competence often possess the least accurate metacognitive knowledge about their abilities, while high performers sometimes underestimate their relative standing.

**Task variables** encompass knowledge about how task characteristics influence cognitive demand. Understanding that recognizing previously seen information is easier than recalling it without cues, that abstract concepts require more processing than concrete ones, or that dense technical material demands slower reading—all exemplify task variable knowledge. This knowledge enables learners to allocate attention and effort appropriately. Educational research shows that learners often possess surprisingly incomplete task knowledge: **students frequently treat all text as requiring equivalent processing depth, fail to distinguish between understanding and memorization as learning goals, and underestimate the difficulty of transfer tasks compared to familiar problem types.**

**Strategy variables** consist of knowledge about cognitive strategies—their nature, effectiveness, and appropriate application. Knowing that elaborative interrogation enhances retention more than simple repetition, that distributed practice surpasses massed practice, or that self-testing provides more effective study than repeated reading all represent strategy knowledge. The educational challenge lies in the gap between possessing strategy knowledge and actually deploying strategies—a phenomenon termed the "production deficiency" in developmental psychology. Many students know that certain strategies work but fail to use them spontaneously, suggesting that knowledge alone proves insufficient without regulatory capability.
