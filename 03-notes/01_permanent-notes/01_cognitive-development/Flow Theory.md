> [!definition]
> - **Key-Term**:[[Flow Theory]]
> - [**Definition**:Describes a distinctive state of consciousness in which individuals experience complete absorption in an activity, characterized by intense focus, loss of self-consciousness, distorted time perception, and the merging of action and awareness.]
> - [Developed by:[[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]] late 1960's]

> [!principle-point]
> Clear goals and immediate feedback are essential preconditions for flow. In PKB work, this means that every interaction should have obvious intent and provide confirmation of results.

> [!core-principle]
> Flow occurs when perceived challenge and personal skill achieve dynamic balance, creating a state where the task is neither so difficult as to produce anxiety nor so simple as to generate boredom. This balance must be continuously recalibrated as skills develop and challenges evolve.

> **Csikszentmihalyi's** research identified **eight** *characteristic dimensions* of the *flow experience*:
>
> 1. Clear goals that provide direction and structure.
> 2. Immediate feedback confirming progress.
> 3. A balance between perceived challenges and personal skills.
> 4. Merging of action and awareness where self-consciousness disappears.
> 5. Concentration on the task at hand to the exclusion of distractions.
> 6. Sense of personal control over the situation and outcomes.
> 7. Loss of self-consciousness and ego.
> 8. Transformation of time perception where hours feel like minutes.
