> [!definition]
> - **Key-Term**:[[Self-Determination Theory]]
> - [**Definition**:(SDT), developed by [[Edward Deci]] and [[Richard Ryan]] beginning in the 1985, posits that three innate psychological needs—[[Autonomy]], [[Competence]], and [[Relatedness]]—are essential for optimal human functioning, and when these needs are satisfied, individuals demonstrate enhanced self-motivation, performance, and psychological well-being. SDT has become one of the most empirically validated frameworks in motivational psychology, with applications spanning education, workplace psychology, healthcare, and technology design. For understanding PKB engagement, SDT provides a powerful lens through which to examine why certain system characteristics promote sustained use while others lead to abandonment.]
> - [Developed by:[[Edward Deci]] and [[Richard Ryan]] beginning in the 1985]

> [!definition]
> - **Key-Term**:[[Self-Determination Theory]]
> - [**Definition**:**(SDT)** is a macro-theory of human motivation and personality that distinguishes between autonomous (self-determined) and controlled motivations, proposing that psychological wellness and optimal functioning depend upon the satisfaction of three universal, innate psychological needs: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Unlike theories focused solely on the *quantity* of motivation, SDT emphasizes that the *quality* of motivation—specifically, whether behavior is experienced as voluntary versus compelled—fundamentally determines both performance outcomes and psychological well-being.]

**Self Determination Theory**

> - The system must continuously demonstrate its value through tangible returns on the user's investment of time and cognitive effort
> - Controlling environments—characterized by pressure, deadlines without explanation, and limited choice—undermine both motivation and performance even when learners comply outwardly with demands.

1. Adults need to understand why they need to learn something
2. Adults bring extensive life experience that should inform learning
3. Adults have a psychological need to be responsible for their own learning decisions
4. Adults are ready to learn when training addresses an immediate, relevant problem
5. Adults prefer learning that is problem-centered rather than content-centered
6. Adults are primarily driven by internal rather than external motivators

> [!key-claim]
> SDT maintains that when social and environmental conditions support the satisfaction of these three basic psychological needs, individuals will demonstrate autonomous motivation, high-quality engagement, psychological wellness, and optimal performance. Conversely, when these needs are thwarted, individuals exhibit controlled motivation, disengagement, ill-being, and poor performance.

> [!definition]
> - **Autonomy** refers to the psychological need to experience oneself as the origin of one's own behavior, to act in harmony with one's integrated sense of self rather than being controlled by external forces or internal pressures.
>
> - **Competence** concerns the fundamental human need to feel effective in one's interactions with the environment, to experience mastery and growth in pursuing meaningful challenges.
>
> - **Relatedness** addresses the human need to feel connected to others, to experience oneself as part of a larger community and to have one's existence matter to significant others.

> [!topic-idea]
> - **Topic or Idea**:[[Self-Determination Theory]]
> - **Key Figure(s)**:*Edward L. Deci*, *Richard M. Ryan*
> - **Description**:A macro-theory of human motivation arguing that optimal well-being and performance are fostered by satisfying three universal, innate psychological needs: **autonomy** (control over one's life), **competence** (mastery and effectiveness), and **relatedness** (connection to others). Fulfilling these needs cultivates the highest quality of motivation: [[Intrinsic Motivation]].
