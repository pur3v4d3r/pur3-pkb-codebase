# 1. 💡 DEFINITION & CORE CONCEPTS

> [!definition]
>
>   - **Key-Term**:[[Logical Fallacy]]
>   - **Definition**:A logical fallacy is an error in reasoning that undermines the logical validity or soundness of an argument. It is a defect in the argument's form or content that makes its conclusion unsupported, even if the premises are true. Fallacies are not factual errors (e.g., "The capital of France is Berlin"); rather, they are errors in the *process* of moving from premises to a conclusion.

## FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS

A [[logical argument]] is traditionally composed of premises (statements of evidence) and a conclusion (the proposition derived from that evidence). A strong argument is both **valid** and **sound**. A [[valid argument]] is one where the conclusion *must* be true if the premises are true (a perfect logical structure). A [[sound argument]] is a valid argument that *also* has true premises.

Fallacies are "broken" arguments. They are deceptive because they often mimic the *appearance* of a valid argument but fail under scrutiny. They are the primary tools of [[sophistry]] and [[propaganda]], but they are just as often committed unintentionally.

The most critical distinction in the study of fallacies is between **Formal** and **Informal** types. This classification provides the fundamental architecture for analyzing any error in reasoning.

> [!key-claim]
> **Central Principle**
> The presence of a logical fallacy **invalidates the argument**, but it does **not** automatically mean the argument's **conclusion is false**. This insight is so important it has its own name: the **Fallacy Fallacy**. You cannot win a debate simply by pointing out your opponent's fallacy; you can only demonstrate that their *reasoning* for their conclusion is flawed.

-----

# 2. ⛓️ FORMAL FALLACIES

> [!definition]
>
>   - **Key-Term**:[[Formal Fallacy]]
>   - **Definition**:A formal fallacy (or *deductive fallacy*) is an error in the **logical structure** or **form** of an argument. The argument is invalid *because* of its form, regardless of the content of its premises. You can identify a formal fallacy without even understanding what the argument is about, simply by analyzing its symbolic structure.

## FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS

Formal fallacies apply only to [[deductive arguments]], which aim to provide conclusions that are logically certain. These fallacies are essentially "non-sequiturs," where the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.

The two most common formal fallacies occur in propositional logic, specifically by misusing a hypothetical syllogism ($If P, then Q$).

## TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

| Fallacy Name | Form (Symbolic Logic) | Explanation | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Affirming the Consequent** | $If P \to Q$. $Q$. $Therefore, P$. | The argument incorrectly assumes that because the consequent (Q) is true, the antecedent (P) must also be true. This ignores that other factors could also lead to Q. | "If this liquid is acid (P), it will turn litmus paper red (Q). The paper is red (Q). Therefore, this liquid is acid (P)." <br> (This is fallacious; water with red dye would also turn it red.) |
| **Denying the Antecedent** | $If P \to Q$. $\neg P$. $Therefore, \neg Q$. | The argument incorrectly assumes that if the antecedent (P) is false, the consequent (Q) must also be false. This ignores that Q could be true for other reasons. | "If you are a doctor (P), you have a high-paying job (Q). You are not a doctor ($\neg P$). Therefore, you do not have a high-paying job ($\neg Q$)." <br> (This is fallacious; lawyers, engineers, etc. also have high-paying jobs.) |
| **Invalid Syllogism** | Varies (e.g., *Fallacy of the Undistributed Middle*) | In a categorical syllogism, the term that links the two premises (the middle term) is not properly distributed, failing to create a necessary logical link. | "All cats (A) are mammals (B). All dogs (C) are mammals (B). Therefore, all cats (A) are dogs (C)." <br> (The middle term "mammals" is not distributed, as neither premise makes a claim about *all* mammals.) |

# 3. 🧠 INFORMAL FALLACIES

> [!definition]
>
>   - **Key-Term**:[[Informal Fallacy]]
>   - **Definition**:An informal fallacy is an error in reasoning that occurs due to a problem with the **content, context, or delivery** of the argument, rather than its logical structure. An argument with an informal fallacy might be *formally valid* but is still unsound or weak because the premises are irrelevant, insufficient, or rely on unproven assumptions.

## FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS

Informal fallacies are the most common type encountered in everyday life—in debates, politics, media, and advertising. They are "informal" because you cannot identify them by analyzing their symbolic structure alone; you must understand the *meaning* and *context* of the language being used.

These fallacies are persuasive because they often appeal to human emotions, psychological biases, or linguistic ambiguity. They are best understood by grouping them into families based on *how* they fail.

> [!key-claim]
> **Central Principle**
> Identifying an informal fallacy requires **critical listening** and **contextual awareness**. Unlike formal fallacies, you cannot spot them with a simple formula. You must ask: Are the premises *relevant*? Are they *sufficient*? Are they *assuming* the conclusion? Is the language *clear*?

-----

# 4. 🗂️ EXHAUSTIVE TAXONOMY OF INFORMAL FALLACIES

The most robust and widely accepted classification model for informal fallacies breaks them into four distinct categories.

## 4.1 ✨ FALLACIES OF RELEVANCE

These arguments are fallacious because their premises are **not logically relevant** to the conclusion. They attempt to prove a conclusion by introducing information that is emotionally or psychologically persuasive but logically disconnected.

| Fallacy Name | Definition | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ad Hominem** (Argument to the Person) | Attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument, rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself. | "You say the new tax law is a bad idea? You're just a greedy billionaire, so of course you'd be against it." |
| **Straw Man** | Misrepresenting, exaggerating, or fabricating an opponent's argument to make it easier to attack. | **Person A:** "I think we should invest more in public transit." <br> **Person B:** "So you want to ban all cars and force everyone into crowded buses? That's a ridiculous attack on personal freedom." |
| **Red Herring** (Ignoratio Elenchi) | Introducing an irrelevant topic into an argument to divert the audience's attention from the original issue. | **Reporter:** "Mr. Mayor, the city's deficit is up 20%." <br> **Mayor:** "I'm glad you ask about the city. We've just opened three new parks, which families love. Our children are our future." |
| **Appeal to Pity** (Ad Misericordiam) | Attempting to win support for an argument by exploiting the audience's feelings of pity, sympathy, or guilt. | "Professor, I know I failed all the exams, but I was having a really tough semester. If I don't pass this class, I'll lose my scholarship. You *have* to give me a C." |
| **Appeal to Force** (Ad Baculum) | Supporting a conclusion by threatening the listener with harm (physical, financial, or otherwise) if they do not accept it. | "You'll agree with the new company policy, won't you? It would be a shame if we had to re-evaluate your position here." |
| **Appeal to the People** (Ad Populum) | Claiming a conclusion is true because it is a popular belief, or using emotionally charged language to gain popular approval. (Includes the **Bandwagon Fallacy**). | "Everyone is buying this new smartphone, so it must be the best one on the market." |
| **Appeal to Authority** (Ad Verecundiam) | Citing an "authority" on a topic, but the person is not a qualified expert in that specific field, or the experts in the field disagree. | "My favorite actor, who has won three Oscars, says that this new brand of vitamins is the key to good health." |
| **Genetic Fallacy** | Judging an argument or idea based on its origin (its "genesis") or history, rather than its current merits or content. | "You're only a Christian because you were born in America to Christian parents. Therefore, your beliefs are false." (This also applies to discrediting an idea, e.g., "That medical theory originated in Nazi Germany, so it's evil.") |

## 4.2 🧐 FALLACIES OF WEAK INDUCTION

These arguments are fallacious because their premises, while relevant, are **too weak or insufficient** to support the conclusion. The logical leap from the evidence to the claim is too large.

| Fallacy Name | Definition | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hasty Generalization** | Drawing a broad conclusion about a whole class of things based on a small or unrepresentative sample. | "I ate at that restaurant once and the food was terrible. All of their food must be awful." (This is the source of many stereotypes.) |
| **Weak Analogy** | Comparing two things that are not relevantly similar, or where the points of similarity are too few or superficial to support the conclusion. | "Guns are just tools, like hammers. It would be ridiculous to restrict hammer sales, so it's ridiculous to restrict gun sales." |
| **Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc** (After this, therefore because of this) | Assuming that because one event (B) occurred *after* another event (A), that A must have *caused* B. | "I wore my lucky socks to the game, and we won\! My socks caused the victory." (Correlation does not equal causation.) |
| **Slippery Slope** | Arguing that a small, seemingly harmless first step will inevitably lead to a chain of related, catastrophic consequences without providing sufficient evidence for the inevitability. | "If we allow gay marriage, the next thing you know, people will be marrying their pets and their cars." |
| **Appeal to Ignorance** (Ad Ignorantiam) | Asserting that a claim is true because it has not been proven false, or false because it has not been proven true. | "No one has ever definitively proven that aliens *haven't* visited Earth, so they must have." |

## 4.3 🔁 FALLACIES OF PRESUMPTION

These arguments are fallacious because they **make an implicit assumption** that is dubious, unproven, or is the very thing that needs to be proven. The argument "presumes" its own conclusion.

| Fallacy Name | Definition | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Begging the Question** (Petitio Principii) | An argument where the conclusion is already assumed in one of the premises. This is also known as "circular reasoning." | "The Bible is the word of God. How do I know? Because the Bible itself says it is." <br> "We must have a death penalty to stop violent crime." (This presumes the death penalty *does* stop violent crime.) |
| **False Dilemma** (False Dichotomy) | Presenting only two choices or outcomes as the *only* possibilities, when in fact more options exist. | "You're either with us, or you're with the terrorists." <br> "We can either cut social programs or live with a crippling national debt. There is no other choice." |
| **Complex Question** | A question that is phrased in a way that presupposes a conclusion or fact that has not been established. (A "loaded question"). | "Have you stopped cheating on your exams?" (A "yes" or "no" answer implicitly admits you *were* cheating at some point.) |

## 4.4 🌊 FALLACIES OF AMBIGUITY

These arguments are fallacious because they exploit **unclear, vague, or double-meaning** words or grammatical structures. The argument's apparent validity depends on this linguistic confusion.

| Fallacy Name | Definition | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Equivocation** | Using a key word or phrase in an argument that has two or more different meanings, and shifting between those meanings to make the argument appear to work. | "A feather is light. What is light cannot be dark. Therefore, a feather cannot be dark." (The word "light" shifts meaning from weight to color.) |
| **Amphiboly** | An ambiguity that arises from poor or confusing grammatical structure, rather than a single word. | "The tourist saw a man on the hill with a telescope." (Who has the telescope? The tourist or the man?) |
| **Fallacy of Composition** | Incorrectly reasoning that what is true of the *parts* must also be true of the *whole*. | "Every player on this team is a superstar. Therefore, this must be the best team in the
league." (The players may not have good chemistry.) |
| **Fallacy of Division** | Incorrectly reasoning that what is true of the *whole* must also be true of the *parts*. | "That is a very expensive and well-respected university. Therefore, every single professor who works there must be excellent." |

# 5. 🔬 ADVANCED CONSIDERATIONS

## DISTINCTION FROM [[Cognitive Biases]]

This is a critical, high-level distinction that is often confused.

> [!definition]
>
>   - **Key-Term**:[[as]] vs. [[Logical Fallacy]]
>   - **Definition**::
>       - **Logical Fallacies** are errors in **argumentation** (an external, linguistic act). They are flaws in *how an argument is constructed* to persuade.
>       - **Cognitive Biases** are errors in **thinking** (an internal, psychological process). They are mental shortcuts (heuristics) that lead to flawed *judgments* or *perceptions*.

A cognitive bias can *cause* a person to commit a logical fallacy. For example:

  - A person's **Confirmation Bias** (a cognitive bias) might lead them to commit a **Hasty Generalization** (a logical fallacy). They seek out two or three examples that confirm their belief and then generalize to a whole population, ignoring all counter-evidence.

## FALLACIES IN THE DIGITAL AGE: MEDIA & AI

The structure of modern digital communication platforms can amplify certain fallacies.

> [!use-cases-and-examples]
> **Real-World Applications**
>
> 1.  **Context**: Social Media (e.g., X/Twitter)
> **Application**: Character limits and the fast pace of "the feed" make the [[Straw Man]] fallacy incredibly effective. It's easier to dunk on a simplified, misrepresentative version of an opponent's argument than to engage with its nuance. The [[Ad Populum]] (Bandwagon) fallacy is also amplified, where an idea's "virality" (likes/shares) is used as a proxy for its truth.
> 2.  **Context**: AI-Generated Content (e.g., LLMs)
> **Application**: AI models can commit fallacies. A common one is a sophisticated **Appeal to Authority**. An AI, by stating information with confidence and a formal tone, acts as its own "authority." Because its knowledge is based on statistical patterns in data, it can also commit the **Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc** fallacy, presenting a correlation it found in its data as a causal relationship.
> 3.  **Context**: Online Debates (e.g., Reddit/YouTube)
> **Application**: The **Gish Gallop** is a rhetorical technique (a type of [[Red Herring]]) where a debater overwhelms their opponent with a sheer number of individually weak or fallacious arguments. The opponent cannot possibly debunk every single point in the time allotted, making the "Galloper" appear to have "won" the debate.

# 6. 📜 HISTORICAL CONTEXT: ARISTOTLE'S 13 FALLACIES

The systematic study of fallacies began with [[Aristotle]] in his work *De Sophisticis Elenchis* (*Sophistical Refutations*). He identified 13 fallacies that "sophists" (paid teachers of rhetoric) used to win arguments regardless of the truth.

His classification was the standard for over two millennia and serves as the foundation for the modern taxonomy.

> [!quick-reference]
> **Aristotle's Original Classification**

>   - 🔑 **Fallacies Dependent on Language (In Dictione)**: These correspond roughly to the modern [[\#Fallacies of Ambiguity]].

> <!-- end list -->

> 1.  Equivocation
> 2.  Amphiboly
> 3.  Composition
> 4.  Division
> 5.  Accent (ambiguity from punctuation/emphasis)
> 6.  Figure of Speech (ambiguity from word form)
> 
> <!-- end list -->

>   - 🔑 **Fallacies Not Dependent on Language (Extra Dictionem)**: These are the ancestors of modern [[\#Fallacies of Relevance]] and [[\#Fallacies of Presumption]].
>

> 8.  Converse Accident (applying a special case to a general rule)
> 9.  Irrelevant Conclusion (Ignoratio Elenchi)
> 10. Begging the Question (Petitio Principii)
> 11. False Cause (similar to *Post Hoc*)
> 12. Complex Question
> 13. Affirming the Consequent

# 🎯 SYNTHESIS & MASTERY

> [!the-philosophy]
> **Underlying Philosophy**
> The study of fallacies is not merely a tool for "winning" debates or pointing out others' flaws. It is a foundational practice of **intellectual self-defense**. Its ultimate purpose is to cultivate [[Critical Thinking]] by forcing us to examine the *quality* of our reasoning, not just the *content* of our beliefs. Mastering fallacies is the first step toward building arguments that are not just persuasive, but also valid and sound—arguments that are tethered to [[truth]].

## COGNITIVE MODELS

> [!analogy]
> **Illuminating Comparison: The Argument as a Bridge**
>
>   - **Premises** are the bridge's **foundations** (pillars).
>   - **Logic** is the **structure** (trusses, cables) that connects them.
>   - The **Conclusion** is the **far side** of the bridge.
> 
> A **Formal Fallacy** is a **broken structure**. The cables don't connect, the math is wrong. Even if the pillars are solid granite, the bridge is invalid and will collapse. You cannot cross it. (e.g., *Affirming the Consequent*).
>
> An **Informal Fallacy** is a **problem with the foundations**. The bridge's structure might be *designed* correctly, but...
>
>   - ...the pillars are built on sand (**Fallacy of Weak Induction**).
>   - ...the pillars are built on the *other side* of the river to begin with (**Fallacy of Presumption**).
>   - ...the "pillars" are actually a mirage or an unrelated topic (**Fallacy of Relevance**).

## COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS: FALLACY VS. FALLACY

| Approach | Strengths (Persuasiveness) | Weaknesses (Logical Flaw) | Use When (Rhetorical Goal) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Straw Man** | Easy to win; makes the opponent look extreme or foolish. | Misrepresents the opponent's actual position; intellectually dishonest. | To discredit an opponent in front of an audience that hasn't heard the original argument. |
| **Ad Hominem** | Powerful emotional appeal; taps into tribalism and personal dislike. | Fails to engage with the argument's merits; irrelevant. | To poison the well and turn an audience against the *messenger*, ignoring the *message*. |
| **Slippery Slope** | Taps into fear (a strong motivator); paints a vivid, catastrophic future. | Relies on an unproven chain of causation; speculates without evidence. | To prevent a small, initial change by exaggerating its future consequences. |
| **False Dilemma** | Creates urgency; simplifies a complex issue and forces a choice (often favoring the speaker's position). | Artificially limits options; ignores nuance and alternative solutions. | To "force" a listener's hand by presenting the only other option as clearly terrible. |

# 1.0 CORE PRINCIPLES: FORMAL VS. INFORMAL FALLACIES

> [!definition]
>
>   - **Key-Term**:[[Logical Fallacy]]
>   - **Definition**:A **fallacy** is the use of invalid or otherwise faulty reasoning in the construction of an argument. A fallacious argument may be deceptive by appearing to be better than it really is.

## 1.1 FORMAL FALLACIES

A **[[Formal Fallacy]]** is an error in reasoning that can be identified by analyzing the **logical structure** (the "form") of the argument alone, regardless of its content. The argument is **invalid** because the conclusion does not follow from the premises, even if the premises themselves are true.

> [!key-claim]
> **Central Principle**
> In a formal fallacy, the pattern of reasoning is *always* wrong. You can spot the error without knowing what the argument is *about*.

## 1.2 INFORMAL FALLACIES

An **[[Informal Fallacy]]** is an error in reasoning that occurs due to a flaw in the **content, context, or language** of an argument, not its logical structure. An argument containing an informal fallacy might be *formally valid* (its structure is correct) but is still **unsound** or unpersuasive because a premise is irrelevant, unsupported, or ambiguous.

> [!key-claim]
> **Central Principle**
> In an informal fallacy, you must understand *what* is being said (the content) to spot the error. These are the most common fallacies in debate, media, and everyday life.

-----

# 2.0 ⚙️ FORMAL FALLACIES (ERRORS IN STRUCTURE)

Formal fallacies are best understood using symbolic logic. They mimic valid forms of reasoning but are structurally flawed. The two most common valid forms they mimic are **Modus Ponens** (If P then Q; P; Therefore Q) and **Modus Tollens** (If P then Q; Not Q; Therefore Not P).

## 2.1 AFFIRMING THE CONSEQUENT

> [!definition]
>
>   - **Key-Term**:[[Affirming the Consequent]]
>   - **Definition**:This fallacy takes the form of assuming that if the consequence (Q) is true, then the antecedent (P) must also be true. This is an invalid inversion of Modus Ponens.

> [!equation]
> **Mathematical Foundation**
>
>   - **Invalid Form**: $[(P \rightarrow Q), Q] \vdash P$
>   - (If P then Q. Q is true. Therefore, P is true.)
> 
> **Example**:
>
> 1.  **Premise 1**: If it is raining (P), then the street is wet (Q).
> 2.  **Premise 2**: The street is wet (Q).
> 3.  **Invalid Conclusion**: Therefore, it is raining (P).
> 
> **Flaw**: The street could be wet for other reasons (e.g., a street cleaner, melted snow).

## 2.2 DENYING THE ANTECEDENT

> [!definition]
>
>   - **Key-Term**:[[Denying the Antecedent]]
>   - **Definition**:This fallacy takes the form of assuming that if the antecedent (P) is false, then the consequence (Q) must also be false. This is an invalid inversion of Modus Tollens.

> [!equation]
> **Mathematical Foundation**
>
>   - **Invalid Form**: $[(P \rightarrow Q), \neg P] \vdash \neg Q$
>   - (If P then Q. P is false. Therefore, Q is false.)
> 
> **Example**:
>
> 1.  **Premise 1**: If I am a cat (P), then I am a mammal (Q).
> 2.  **Premise 2**: I am not a cat (Not P).
> 3.  **Invalid Conclusion**: Therefore, I am not a mammal (Not Q).
> 
> **Flaw**: The conclusion is obviously false. Many other things are mammals besides cats.

# 3.0 🏛️ INFORMAL FALLACIES (ERRORS IN CONTENT)

Informal fallacies are broadly classified into three groups based on the *type* of error.

## 3.1 FALLACIES OF RELEVANCE

These fallacies rely on premises that are not logically relevant to the conclusion, even though they may seem psychologically or emotionally persuasive. The argument attempts to **distract** from the central issue.

### 3.1.1 AD HOMINEM ("TO THE PERSON")

> [!definition]
>
>   - **Key-Term**:[[Ad Hominem]]
>   - **Definition**:Attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making an argument rather than addressing the substance of the argument itself.
> 
> **Example**: "You can't trust Dr. Smith's research on climate change (the argument). He's a known philanderer and has terrible fashion sense (the attack)."
>
> **Flaw**: Dr. Smith's personal life has no logical bearing on the validity of his climate data.

### 3.1.2 STRAW MAN

> [!definition]
>
>   - **Key-Term**:[[Straw Man]]
>   - **Definition**:Misrepresenting, exaggerating, or fabricating an opponent's argument to make it easier to attack.
> 
> **Example**:
>
>   - **Person A**: "I think we should increase funding for public schools."
>   - **Person B**: "So you're saying we should throw unlimited money at a broken system and you want to bankrupt the country? That's a terrible idea."
> 
> **Flaw**: Person B did not attack Person A's actual proposal (increasing funding) but a distorted, weaker version of it ("unlimited money," "bankrupt the country").

### 3.1.3 RED HERRING (IGNORATIO ELENCHI)

> [!definition]
>
>   - **Key-Term**:[[Red Herring]]
>   - **Definition**:Introducing an irrelevant topic into an argument to divert the attention of the audience from the original issue.
> 
> **Example**: "While it's true that my company's environmental record is poor (original issue), you have to consider the economy\! Think of how many jobs we provide for this community (irrelevant topic)."
>
> **Flaw**: The issue of jobs, while important, is a separate conversation from the issue of the company's environmental record. It does not refute the original claim. (Compare with [[Straw Man]], which distorts the argument; a Red Herring *changes the subject*.)

### 3.1.4 APPEAL TO AUTHORITY (ARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM)

> [!definition]
>
>   - **Key-Term**:[[Appeal to Authority]]
>   - **Definition**:Asserting that a claim is true simply because a person of authority (or perceived authority) said it is true.
> 
> **Example**: "This new diet plan must be effective because a famous actor on television said he uses it."
>
> **Flaw**: The actor is not a qualified expert in nutrition or medicine. This fallacy is only committed when the "authority" is irrelevant, unqualified, or when experts in the field disagree.

### 3.1.5 APPEAL TO EMOTION (ARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM, ETC.)

> [!definition]
>
>   - **Key-Term**:[[Appeal to Emotion]]
>   - **Definition**:Attempting to persuade an audience by manipulating their emotions (such as pity, fear, anger, or joy) instead of using a valid logical argument.
> 
> **Example**: "This new law must be passed. Think of the poor, suffering children it will help\! (Appeal to Pity)." or "If you don't vote for me, the country will be destroyed by our enemies\! (Appeal to Fear)."
>
> **Flaw**: Emotions are not evidence. A strong emotional response does not validate the conclusion.

### 3.1.6 BANDWAGON FALLACY (ARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM)

> [!definition]
>
>   - **Key-Term**:[[Bandwagon Fallacy]]
>   - **Definition**:Arguing that a claim must be true (or good) because many or most people believe it.
> 
> **Example**: "Billions of people have seen this movie, so it must be one of the greatest films ever made."
>
> **Flaw**: Popularity does not correlate with truth or quality. A large number of people can be, and often are, wrong.

## 3.2 FALLACIES OF PRESUMPTION

These fallacies make an argument based on a hidden, unproven, or flawed assumption. The argument's premises **presuppose** the truth of the conclusion.

### 3.2.1 BEGGING THE QUESTION (PETITIO PRINCIPII)

> [!definition]
>
>   - **Key-Term**:[[Begging the Question]]
>   - **Definition**:A form of [[Circular Reasoning]] where the argument's premises implicitly assume the conclusion they are trying to prove.
> 
> **Example**: "The Bible is the word of God. We know this because the Bible itself tells us so, and the word of God is infallible."
>
> **Flaw**: The argument assumes the Bible is infallible (the conclusion) to prove that it is the word of God (a premise that relies on the conclusion). It "begs" the listener to grant the conclusion from the start.

### 3.2.2 FALSE DILEMMA (BIFURCATION)

> [!definition]
>
>   - **Key-Term**:[[False Dilemma]]
>   - **Definition**:Presenting two opposing options as the *only* two options, when in fact other possibilities exist.
> 
> **Example**: "You're either with us, or you're against us."
>
> **Flaw**: This artificially limits the options. A person could be neutral, partially supportive, or supportive of a different third option entirely.

### 3.2.3 SLIPPERY SLOPE

> [!definition]
>
>   - **Key-Term**:[[Slippery Slope]]
>   - **Definition**:Arguing that a specific, relatively small first step will inevitably lead to a chain of related events, culminating in some significant (usually negative) final effect.
> 
> **Example**: "If we allow gay marriage, the next thing you know, people will be marrying their pets and their cars\!"
>
> **Flaw**: The argument provides no evidence or logical mechanism to prove that the first step (A) will *necessarily* lead to the final effect (Z). It asserts a chain reaction without justification.

### 3.2.4 HASTY GENERALIZATION

> [!definition]
>
>   - **Key-Term**:[[Hasty Generalization]]
>   - **Definition**:Drawing a broad conclusion based on a sample size that is too small or unrepresentative.
> 
> **Example**: "I met two people from New York, and they were both rude. Therefore, all New Yorkers are rude."
>
> **Flaw**: A sample size of two is not statistically significant to make a claim about millions of people. This is the foundation of many stereotypes.

### 3.2.5 FALSE CAUSE (POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC)

> [!definition]
>
>   - **Key-Term**:[[False Cause]]
>   - **Definition**:Assuming that because one event (B) occurred after another event (A), event A must have *caused* event B.
> 
> **Example**: "The team started winning games right after I bought my new hat. My hat must be lucky and is causing them to win."
>
> **Flaw**: **Correlation does not equal causation**. The temporal sequence is a coincidence, not a causal link.

### 3.2.6 APPEAL TO IGNORANCE (ARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIAM)

> [!definition]
>
>   - **Key-Term**:[[Appeal to Ignorance]]
>   - **Definition**:Asserting that a claim is true because it has not been *proven false*, or that a claim is false because it has not been *proven true*.
> 
> **Example**: "No one has ever proven that aliens *don't* exist, so they must be real." OR "No one has ever proven that aliens *do* exist, so they must be fake."
>
> **Flaw**: The **absence of evidence is not evidence of absence** (or presence). The burden of proof lies on the person making the claim.

### 3.2.7 COMPLEX QUESTION (PLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM)

> [!definition]
>
>   - **Key-Term**:[[Complex Question]]
>   - **Definition**:A question that is phrased to include a controversial or unproven assumption that the respondent "confirms" simply by answering.
> 
> **Example**: "Have you stopped cheating on your exams?"
>
> **Flaw**: This question is a trap. A "Yes" answer implies you *used* to cheat. A "No" answer implies you *are still* cheating. The question presupposes the unproven "fact" that you cheated at some point.

## 3.3 FALLACIES OF AMBIGUITY

These fallacies arise from the use of a word, phrase, or sentence structure that has an unclear, vague, or multiple meaning.

### 3.3.1 EQUIVOCATION

> [!definition]
>
>   - **Key-Term**:[[Equivocation]]
>   - **Definition**:Using a key term or phrase in an argument with two or more different meanings, as if it has the same meaning.
> 
> **Example**:
>
> 1.  **Premise 1**: A feather is **light**.
> 2.  **Premise 2**: What is **light** cannot be dark.
> 3.  **Conclusion**: Therefore, a feather cannot be dark.
> 
> **Flaw**: The word "light" is used to mean "not heavy" in Premise 1 and "not dark in color" in Premise 2. The argument is built on a linguistic sleight-of-hand.

### 3.3.2 FALLACY OF COMPOSITION

> [!definition]
>
>   - **Key-Term**:[[Fallacy of Composition]]
>   - **Definition**:Assuming that a property true of the *parts* of a whole must also be true of the *whole* itself.
> 
> **Example**: "Every atom in this table is invisible to the naked eye. Therefore, the table is invisible to the naked eye."
>
> **Flaw**: The whole (table) can have properties (visibility) that its individual parts (atoms) do not.

### 3.3.3 FALLACY OF DIVISION

> [!definition]
>
>   - **Key-Term**:[[Fallacy of Division]]
>   - **Definition**:The reverse of Composition. Assuming that a property true of the *whole* must also be true of its individual *parts*.
> 
> **Example**: "The United States is a wealthy country. Therefore, every American must be wealthy."
>
> **Flaw**: The properties of the collective (national wealth) do not automatically distribute to each individual member.

# 4.0 🎯 SYNTHESIS & MASTERY

> [!the-philosophy]
> **Underlying Philosophy**
> Fallacies are not just academic puzzles; they are the primary tools of manipulation, self-deception, and poor decision-making. Mastering their identification is the first step toward clear thinking. A fallacy is a **failure of an argument to support its conclusion**, and this failure can be structural, relevantial, or semantic.

## 4.1 THE LINK TO COGNITIVE BIASES

It is critical to distinguish between [[Logical Fallacies]] and [[as]].

  - A **[[as]]** is a systematic error in *thinking*. It's a mental shortcut (heuristic) that our brains use, which often leads to poor judgment. Biases are internal and often unconscious.
  - A **[[Logical Fallacy]]** is a systematic error in *argumentation*. It's a flaw in the *expression* of an argument, used to persuade others (or oneself).

Cognitive biases are often the *psychological cause* of logical fallacies.

> [!analogy]
> **Illuminating Comparison**
> A **Cognitive Bias** is like having a faulty sense of direction (internal error in processing).
> A **Logical Fallacy** is like drawing a bad map based on that faulty sense and trying to convince others to follow it (external error in argumentation).

| Cognitive Bias (Thinking Error) | Can Lead To... | Logical Fallacy (Argument Error) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[[Confirmation Bias]]** (Tendency to favor info that confirms existing beliefs) | ... | **[[Hasty Generalization]]** (Cherry-picking data) or **[[Straw Man]]** (Ignoring an opponent's real argument) |
| **[[Sunk Cost Fallacy]]** (Can't abandon a project due to past investment) | ... | **[[Appeal to Emotion]]** (Justifying a bad decision by lamenting the "waste" rather than using logic) |
| **[[Availability Heuristic]]** (Overestimating the importance of recent/vivid examples) | ... | **[[Hasty Generalization]]** (Basing a broad conclusion on a few memorable, but unrepresentative, examples) |
| **[[Groupthink]]** (Desire for harmony leads to irrational consensus) | ... | **[[Bandwagon Fallacy]]** (Assuming the group's consensus must be correct) |

## 4.2 PRACTICAL FALLACY DETECTION

> [!quick-reference]
> **Rapid Lookup: Questions to Ask**
>
>   - 🔑 **Is the argument about the *person* or the *claim*?** If it's about the person, it's likely an [[\#3.1.1 Ad Hominem]].
>   - 🔑 **Is the argument *exaggerating* or *distorting* the opposing view?** If yes, it's a [[\#3.1.2 Straw Man]].
>   - 🔑 **Is the argument *changing the subject*?** If yes, it's a [[\#3.1.3 Red Herring]].
>   - 🔑 **Is the argument *assuming what it's trying to prove*?** If yes, it's [[\#3.2.1 Begging the Question]].
>   - 🔑 **Is the argument *limiting the options* to only two?** If yes, it's a [[\#3.2.2 False Dilemma]].
>   - 🔑 **Is the argument *basing a big conclusion on a tiny sample*?** If yes, it's a [[\#3.2.4 Hasty Generalization]].
>   - 🔑 **Is the argument *confusing sequence with causation*?** If yes, it's a [[\#3.2.5 False Cause]].
>   - 🔑 **Is the argument *relying on a "secret meaning"* of a word?** If yes, it's [[\#3.3.1 Equivocation]].

```
  * **FINDINGS SUMMARY (Search 1):** Confirmed. A **formal fallacy** has a flaw in its *logical structure* (e.g., "Affirming the Consequent"). The argument is invalid even if the premises are true. An **informal fallacy** has an error in its *content, context, or reasoning*, not its structure. The argument might be *formally valid* but is still unpersuasive or incorrect (e.g., "Ad Hominem"). This confirms the primary split for my reference note.

  * **Search 2: Taxonomy**

      * **QUERY RATIONALE:** "I'm searching for 'categories of informal logical fallacies taxonomy' because the 'informal' category is vast and needs sub-organization to be useful. I need a standard, accepted classification system."
      * **EXPECTED INSIGHT:** "This should provide the classical Aristotelian or similar groupings. I'm looking for terms like 'Fallacies of Relevance,' 'Fallacies of Presumption,' and 'Fallacies of Ambiguity' as the main branches."
      * **Tool Call:** (Executed above)
      * **FINDINGS SUMMARY (Search 2):** The search results confirm this taxonomy. Wikipedia and Philosophy Pages (philosophypages.com, fallacyfiles.org) consistently use this three-part structure:
        1.  **Fallacies of Relevance:** The premises are not logically relevant to the conclusion (e.g., Ad Hominem, Red Herring, Appeal to Emotion).
        2.  **Fallacies of Presumption (or Weak Induction/Insufficiency):** The argument rests on a flawed, unstated, or unproven assumption (e.g., Begging the Question, False Dilemma, Hasty Generalization, Slippery Slope).
        3.  **Fallacies of Ambiguity (or Linguistic Fallacies):** The argument uses a word or phrase with unclear or multiple meanings (e.g., Equivocation, Composition, Division).
            This will be the backbone of my note's structure.

  * **Search 3: Master List**

      * **QUERY RATIONALE:** "I'm searching for 'list of common logical fallacies with definitions and examples' to gather the "data" for the note. I need to populate my categories with the most critical fallacies."
      * **EXPECTED INSIGHT:** "This will provide a "greatest hits" list, including Ad Hominem, Straw Man, False Dilemma, Slippery Slope, Hasty Generalization, Red Herring, Appeal to Authority, and Bandwagon. I'll get clear definitions and simple examples."
      * **Tool Call:** (Executed above)
      * **FINDINGS SUMMARY (Search 3):** The results (from Grammarly, Scribbr, UTEP) provide excellent, clear examples for all the fallacies I expected, plus others like Sunk Cost Fallacy, Appeal to Ignorance, and Circular Argument. I have more than enough content to build the core "dictionary" part of the reference. The UTEP list is exceptionally detailed, even including modern/contemporary fallacies.

  * **Search 4: In-depth Categorization**

      * **QUERY RATIONALE:** "I'm searching for 'fallacies of relevance presumption and ambiguity' specifically to ensure I correctly assign the fallacies gathered in Search 3 into the taxonomy from Search 2."
      * **EXPECTED INSIGHT:** "This will confirm, for example, that 'Ad Hominem' is a fallacy of relevance, 'False Dilemma' is a fallacy of presumption, and 'Equivocation' is a fallacy of ambiguity."
      * **Tool Call:** (Executed above)
      * **FINDINGS SUMMARY (Search 4):** The results (Philosophy Pages, Scribd, OKState) do exactly this.
          * **Relevance:** Appeal to Pity, Popular Opinion, Authority, etc.
          * **Presumption:** Accident, False Cause (Post Hoc), Begging the Question, Complex Question.
          * **Ambiguity:** Equivocation, Amphiboly, Accent, Composition, Division.
            This solidifies my organizational plan. I will create a main section for each of these three types and then list the specific fallacies as subsections.

  * **Search 5: Deeper Context**

      * **QUERY RATIONALE:** "I'm searching for 'psychological reasons for logical fallacies cognitive bias link' to build the 'Synthesis & Mastery' section. A good reference note doesn't just list items; it connects them to underlying principles. Why do we *commit* fallacies?"
      * **EXPECTED INSIGHT:** "This should connect logical fallacies (errors in *argumentation*) to cognitive biases (errors in *thinking*). For example, 'Confirmation Bias' (a cognitive bias) can lead to 'Hasty Generalization' (a logical fallacy)."
      * **Tool Call:** (Executed above)
      * **FINDINGS SUMMARY (Search 5):** This is a goldmine. The results (Verywell Mind, Hive Mind, EA Journals) clearly distinguish the two:
          * **Cognitive Biases:** Systematic errors in *thinking/processing* (heuristics, mental shortcuts). Examples: Confirmation Bias, Anchoring Bias, Availability Heuristic, Sunk Cost Fallacy (which is both), Dunning-Kruger.
          * **Logical Fallacies:** Errors in the *structure of an argument* presented to others.
            The key insight is that cognitive biases are the *internal cause*, and logical fallacies are often the *external expression* of those biases. For example, 'Confirmation Bias' (internal) makes you create a 'Straw Man' argument (external) because you're not genuinely listening to the opposing view. This is perfect for the synthesis section.

#### 3\. Knowledge Gap Analysis

  * **What requires deeper investigation?** I have a very strong foundation. The only "gap" might be on *Formal* fallacies. My research heavily (and correctly) focused on *Informal* fallacies, as they are more common in everyday life. I need to make sure I dedicate a specific, albeit smaller, section to formal fallacies and provide the key examples (Affirming the Consequent, Denying the Antecedent).
  * **What conflicting information exists?** The main "conflict" is just one of classification. Some sources (like UTEP) have *massive* lists, while others stick to the classics. Some sources might place a fallacy in a slightly different category (e.g., is Hasty Generalization a Fallacy of Presumption or its own category of Inductive Fallacies?). I will solve this by adopting the most common 3-part taxonomy (Relevance, Presumption, Ambiguity) as my primary structure and noting the alternative classifications. The "Sunk Cost Fallacy" is sometimes listed as a cognitive bias and sometimes as an informal fallacy; I will note this ambiguity.
  * **What cutting-edge developments need inclusion?** The UTEP list's inclusion of "Alternative Truth" and "Appeal to Closure" is very modern. The Scribbr article's connection to "Research Bias" is also a valuable link. I will ensure my synthesis section connects these classical concepts to their modern, real-world applications in media and online discourse.

### Phase 2: Structural Planning

**STRUCTURAL REASONING:**

├── **Core Concept Architecture**
│   ├── **Why this structure?** The note must move from the general to the specific. It starts with the abstract definition ("What is a Fallacy?") and then immediately provides the most important top-level distinction (Formal vs. Informal). This creates a decision tree for the user.
│   └── **Information flow logic:** Definition → Primary Types (Formal/Informal) → Deep Dive into Formal → Deep Dive into Informal → Synthesis. The "Informal Fallacies" section is the largest and must be sub-categorized. The classical taxonomy (Relevance, Presumption, Ambiguity) is the most logical and academically-sound way to do this. The final "Synthesis" section elevates the note from a mere list to a true knowledge resource by connecting it to *why* fallacies exist (Cognitive Biases).
├── **Hierarchy Decisions**
│   ├── **Primary sections:**
│   │   1.  **Core Principles:** Defines the topic.
│   │   2.  **Formal Fallacies:** The first major category. It's deductive and structural. It's important to cover this first as it's more "pure" logic.
│   │   3.  **Informal Fallacies (Taxonomy):** The second and much larger category. This section will act as a container for the three sub-types.
│   │   4.  **Synthesis & Mastery:** The "so what?" section. Connects fallacies to cognitive biases and practical detection.
│   └── **Subsection depth:** The "Informal Fallacies" section will be three levels deep (e.g., `## 3.0 🏛️ Informal Fallacies` → `### 3.1 Fallacies of Relevance` → `#### 3.1.1 Ad Hominem`). This granularity is non-negotiable for a reference document, as a user needs to be able to link *directly* to the "Ad Hominem" definition. Each specific fallacy will have its own H4 heading and a structured definition/example block.
└── **Cross-referencing Strategy**
└── **Internal link opportunities:**
\* Each fallacy in the Table of Contents will link to its definition.
\* [[Cognitive Bias]] will be a major link from the Synthesis section.
\* Within fallacy definitions, I will link to related fallacies. For example, [[Straw Man]] is related to [[Red Herring]] (both are fallacies of relevance/distraction). [[Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc]] will be linked as a specific *type* of [[False Cause]]. [[Begging the Question]] will be linked to [[Circular Reasoning]].
