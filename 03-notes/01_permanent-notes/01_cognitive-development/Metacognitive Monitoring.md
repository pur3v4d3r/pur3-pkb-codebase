> **The [[Metacognitive Monitoring]] Calibration Problem**
>
> Metacognitive monitoring refers to the ability to assess the accuracy and reliability of one's own cognitive processes—to know what you know, recognize what you don't know, and estimate the likelihood that your judgments are correct. Effective decision-making requires well-calibrated metacognition: confidence judgments should track actual accuracy across contexts.
>
> Research consistently demonstrates that human metacognitive calibration is systematically flawed in predictable ways.[^11] People exhibit:
>
> - **[[Overconfidence]]**: Particularly for difficult tasks, people's confidence exceeds their actual accuracy. When people claim to be 90% certain, they are often correct only 70-80% of the time.
> - **[[Dunning-Kruger Effect]]**: Those with the least competence in a domain show the greatest overconfidence, lacking the metacognitive skills to recognize their own deficiencies.
> - **[[Hard-Easy Effect]]**: People are underconfident on easy tasks and overconfident on difficult tasks, with the crossover occurring around 80% actual performance.
> - **[[Hindsight Bias]]**: After learning an outcome, people substantially overestimate how predictable it was beforehand ("I knew it all along").
> 
> The calibration problem has profound implications for checkpoint design. Simply asking people "How confident are you?" does not produce reliable indicators of judgment quality. Instead, effective checkpoints must *test* rather than *query* calibration. This is why techniques like the [[Pre-Mortem Analysis]] are effective—they don't ask whether the plan will succeed (which would elicit overconfident affirmation), but rather *assume* failure and work backwards to identify causes, thereby revealing unrecognized vulnerabilities.
