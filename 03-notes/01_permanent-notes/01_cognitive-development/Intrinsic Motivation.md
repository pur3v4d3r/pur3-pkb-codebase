## Foundational Understanding

> [!definition]
> *Intrinsic motivation* refers to engaging in an activity purely for the inherent satisfaction, enjoyment, or interest it provides, rather than for some separable outcome or external reward. When intrinsically motivated, an individual performs a task because they find it personally rewarding, challenging, or meaningful. It is the drive that comes from within.

> > ### Contrasted with Extrinsic Motivation
> > 
> > While intrinsic motivation stems from internal satisfaction, **extrinsic motivation** involves performing an activity to earn a reward or avoid punishment. Examples include working for a salary, studying for a good grade, or complying with rules to avoid penalties. Both types of motivation can coexist, but intrinsic motivation is generally associated with more profound engagement and lasting satisfaction.

## Key Principles

1. **Internal Drive:** The desire to act comes from inside the individual.
2. **Enjoyment and Satisfaction:** The primary reward is the pleasure derived from the activity itself.
3. **Sense of Accomplishment:** Feeling competent and effective is a strong motivator.
4. **Personal Growth:** Often linked to learning, developing skills, and mastering challenges.
5. **No External Incentives:** Performance is not dependent on praise, money, or other tangible rewards.
