# Self-Regulated Learning

> [!definition]
> - **Key-Term**:[[Self-Regulated Learning]]
> - [**Definition**:Self-regulated learning (SRL) is an active, constructive process whereby learners set goals for their learning and then attempt to monitor, regulate, and control their cognition, motivation, and behavior, guided by their goals and the contextual features of the environment. Essentially, it's about taking charge of one's own learning process.]

## Foundational Understanding
### Characteristics of Self-Regulated Learners

`Self-regulated learners are typically:`
*   **Proactive:** They initiate and direct their own learning.
*   **Goal-Oriented:** They set clear and achievable learning goals.
*   **Strategic:** They use a variety of learning strategies effectively.
*   **Self-Aware:** They understand their strengths and weaknesses as learners.
*   **Reflective:** They evaluate their learning and adjust their approaches.
*   **Motivated:** They maintain motivation and persist through challenges.

### Benefits of Self-Regulated Learning

*   **Improved Academic Performance:** Learners achieve higher grades and deeper understanding.
*   **Increased Learning Efficiency:** They learn more effectively and use their time wisely.
*   **Enhanced Metacognition:** They develop a better awareness and understanding of their own thought processes.
*   **Greater Independence:** They become less reliant on external guidance.
*   **Lifelong Learning Skills:** SRL is crucial for adapting to new information and challenges throughout life.

### Examples

*   A student **plans** to study for an exam by breaking the material into manageable sections over several days (**forethought**).
*   While studying, they **monitor** their understanding by quizzing themselves and re-reading difficult passages (**performance/monitoring**).
*   After the exam, they **reflect** on their study methods, noting which strategies worked well and which didn't, to improve their approach for the next exam (**self-reflection**).
*   An adult learning a new software program **sets a goal** to master a specific feature by the end of the week, **watches tutorials** and practices, and then **evaluates** their proficiency to decide what to learn next.

## Key Principles
`SRL is often described as a cyclical process involving three main phases:`

1. `Forethought and Planning` (*Before Learning*)
	1. `Task Analysis:` Understanding the task, setting goals (e.g., "I need to understand the main arguments of this chapter"), and planning strategies (e.g., "I will skim the chapter first, then read in detail, making notes on key terms").
	2. `Self-Motivation Beliefs:` Assessing one's belief in their ability to succeed (*self-efficacy*), valuing the task, and anticipating positive outcomes.
2. `Performance and Monitoring` (*During Learning*)
	1. `Self-Control:` Implementing the chosen strategies and focusing attention. This involves actively engaging with the material.
	2. `Self-Observation:` Monitoring one's own progress and understanding (e.g., "Am I understanding this concept?"). This might involve self-testing or asking oneself questions.
3. `Self-Reflection and Evaluation` (*After Learning*)
	1. `Self-Judgment:` Evaluating one's performance against the initial goals (e.g., "Did I achieve my goal of understanding the main arguments?").
	2. `Self-Reaction:` Responding to one's performance with positive or negative feelings, and making adaptations for future learning (e.g., "I didn't understand that part, so next time I'll try a different study method or ask for help"). This phase informs the next forethought phase, making the process cyclical.

This framework integrates [[Metacognition]] and [[Self-Regulation Theory]] directly into the academic context. It involves three key phases: **forethought** (planning/goal setting), **performance** (monitoring/strategy use), and **self-reflection** (evaluating/adapting).
