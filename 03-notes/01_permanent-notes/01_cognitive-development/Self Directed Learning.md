[[Self-Directed Learning]] (SDL) represents the operational manifestation of Humanistic Learning Theory. The SDL process follows this structure:

**Diagnostic Phase**: The learner conducts a self-assessment to identify learning needs, existing knowledge gaps, and personal learning preferences. This requires high [[Metacognitive Awareness]]—the ability to accurately perceive one's own cognitive strengths and limitations.

**Planning Phase**: Rather than following prescribed curricula, the learner designs a personalized learning plan with self-determined objectives, resources, and timelines. This activates the [[Planning Fallacy]] mitigation strategy of building in flexibility and iteration.

**Execution Phase**: The learner engages with self-selected resources, experiments with application, and pursues questions that emerge organically. The role of formal instruction, if present, becomes facilitation rather than transmission.

**Evaluation Phase**: Assessment is primarily self-evaluative, focusing on personal growth metrics rather than external standards. The learner asks: "Have I changed? Do I understand differently? Can I do what I previously could not?"
