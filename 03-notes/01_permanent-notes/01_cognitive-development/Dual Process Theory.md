> [!definition]
> - **Key-Term**:[[Dual-Process Theory]]
> - **Definition**:
>   1. A theoretical framework positing two distinct modes of cognitive processing: [[System 1]] (fast, automatic, intuitive, associative) and [[System 2]] (slow, deliberate, analytical, rule-based).
>   2. The interaction and occasional conflict between these systems explains many patterns of human judgment and decision-making, including the persistence of [[Cognitive Biases|Cognitive Biases]] even among highly intelligent, well-trained individuals.
>   3. A *psychological framework* suggesting that **human thought** and **reasoning** are *governed by two distinct modes*: an intuitive, fast, and automatic system ([[System 1]]) and a deliberate, slow, and effortful system ([[System 2]]).
