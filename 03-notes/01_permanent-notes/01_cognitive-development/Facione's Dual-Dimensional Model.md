# Facione's Dual-Dimensional Model

> [!definition]
> - **Key-Term**:[[Facione's Dual-Dimensional Model]]
> - [**Definition**:Facione's Dual-Dimensional Model, developed by Peter A. Facione based on the Delphi Report consensus definition of critical thinking, provides a comprehensive framework that posits critical thinking is comprised of two interdependent dimensions: **cognitive skills** and **affective dispositions** (or habits of mind). It argues that effective critical thinking requires not only the ability to perform certain cognitive operations but also the inclination to do so.]

## Foundational Understanding

### Core Idea: Skills and Dispositions
> The "dual-dimensional" aspect is central to the model. It highlights that critical thinking is not just about *what one can do* (the skills) but also about *how one is inclined to do it* (the dispositions). Both dimensions are essential for consistent and effective critical thinking.

`Dimension 1: Critical Thinking Skills (Cognitive Skills)`
>These are the core intellectual abilities required for purposeful, self-regulatory judgment. The Delphi Report identified six essential cognitive skills:
1. **Interpretation**: To comprehend and express the meaning or significance of a wide variety of experiences, situations, data, events, judgments, conventions, beliefs, rules, procedures, or criteria. This includes categorization, decoding significance, and clarifying meaning.
2. **Analysis**: To identify the intended and actual inferential relationships among statements, questions, concepts, descriptions, or other forms of representation. This involves examining ideas, detecting arguments, and analyzing arguments.
3. **Inference**: To identify and secure elements needed to draw reasonable conclusions; to form conjectures and hypotheses; to consider relevant information and to deduce the consequences flowing from data, statements, principles, evidence, judgments, beliefs, opinions, concepts, descriptions, questions, or other forms of representation. This includes querying evidence, conjecturing alternatives, and drawing conclusions.
4. **Explanation**: To state the results of one's reasoning; to justify that reasoning in terms of the evidential, conceptual, methodological, criteriological, and contextual considerations upon which one's results were based; and to present one's reasoning in the form of cogent arguments. This involves stating results, justifying procedures, and presenting arguments.
5. **Evaluation**: To assess the credibility of statements or other representations (e.g., assessing the source's credibility) and to assess the logical strength of the actual or intended inferential relationships among statements, descriptions, questions, or other forms of representation (e.g., judging argument quality).
6. **Self-Regulation**: Self-consciously to monitor one’s cognitive activities, the elements used in those activities, and the results educed, particularly by applying skills in analysis and evaluation to one’s own inferential judgments with a view toward questioning, confirming, validating, or correcting either one’s reasoning or one’s results. This encompasses self-examination and self-correction.

`Dimension 2: Critical Thinking Dispositions (Affective Dispositions / Habits of Mind)`
> These are the characteristic attitudes, intellectual virtues, or habits of mind that lead one to apply critical thinking skills. They represent the "will" or inclination to think critically. Key dispositions include:
1. **Truth-seeking**: A courageous desire for the best understanding of a situation, coupled with an honest objective pursuit of the truth, even if it challenges one's own beliefs.
2. **Open-mindedness**: Being tolerant of divergent views and sensitive to the possibility of one's own bias. Being willing to consider a variety of possible opinions or explanations.
3. **Analyticity**: Prizing the application of reasoning and the use of evidence to resolve problems. Being alert to potential problems, vigilant in anticipating consequences, and inclined to use reason and evidence.
4. **Systematicity**: Being orderly, organized, focused, and diligent in inquiry. Approaching problems with a structured and methodical mindset.
5. **Self-confidence**: Trusting one's own reasoned judgments and believing in one's ability to reason well.
6. **Inquisitiveness**: Eagerness to acquire knowledge and understand how things work, even when the immediate utility of that knowledge is not clear.
7. **Maturity of Judgment**: Prudence in making, suspending, or revising judgment; recognizing the complexity of problems, and understanding that some problems have more than one plausible solution.

## The Interplay and Synergy
 Facione's model emphasizes that neither skills nor dispositions alone are sufficient for robust critical thinking.
-   A person possessing strong critical thinking skills but lacking the disposition to use them consistently or appropriately will not be an effective critical thinker.
-   Conversely, an individual with strong critical thinking dispositions but underdeveloped skills may be eager to think critically but lack the competence to do so effectively.
The dispositions **activate** and **guide** the application of the skills, ensuring they are employed systematically, fairly, and consistently. The skills, in turn, provide the means by which the dispositions are enacted.

## Practical Applications
> The Dual-Dimensional Model has significant implications for:

> [!example] Application 1
> *Description*: **Education**: It highlights the need for curricula and pedagogical approaches that not only teach critical thinking skills explicitly but also foster the necessary dispositions. Educators should create environments that encourage students to be inquisitive, open-minded, and truth-seeking.

> [!example] Application 2
> *Description*: **Assessment**: It suggests that a comprehensive assessment of critical thinking must include measures for both cognitive skills (e.g., California Critical Thinking Skills Test - CCTST) and affective dispositions (e.g., California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory - CCTDI).

> [!example] Application 3
> *Description*: **Professional Development**: Organizations can use this framework to develop training programs that enhance employees' ability and willingness to think critically in the workplace.

## Conclusion
> Facione's Dual-Dimensional Model offers a robust and holistic framework for understanding, teaching, and assessing critical thinking. By acknowledging both the cognitive "can do" and the affective "will do" aspects, it provides a more complete and nuanced picture of what it means to be a truly skilled and disposed critical thinker, moving beyond a simplistic view of critical thinking as merely a set of intellectual techniques.
