> [!definition]
> - **Key-Term**:[[Curve Of Forgetting]]
> - [**Definition**:A mathematical relationship describing how memory retention declines precipitously over time without active effort to maintain it.]

**Forgetting Curve**
1. Better memory representation through mnemonic techniques and encoding strategies.
2. Repetition based on active recall, particularly through spaced intervals.

> [!insight]
> Research demonstrates that the importance attributed to information significantly affects forgetting rates—material perceived as critical to one's goals or identity resists decay more effectively than information considered peripheral.
