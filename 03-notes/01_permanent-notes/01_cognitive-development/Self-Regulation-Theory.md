> - **Key Figure(s)**:*Roy Baumeister*, *Albert Bandura*
> - **Description**:A broad framework explaining how individuals monitor, control, and direct their own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors to achieve goals. It often involves a "strength" or resource model, suggesting that self-control is a limited resource that can be depleted (a concept known as **ego depletion**). [[Albert Bandura]]'s work, in particular, emphasizes the role of **self-efficacy** (belief in one's capabilities) in this process.
