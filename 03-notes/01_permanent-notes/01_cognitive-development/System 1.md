| **[[System 1]]** | **Fast**, automatic, intuitive, emotional, unconscious, high-capacity, low-effort   | Manages 98% of daily tasks: driving a car, understanding language, recognizing faces, reacting to danger | **The source of biases**. It uses heuristics to generate "good enough" answers instantly.                                                              |
| **[[System 2]]** | **Slow**, deliberate, analytical, logical, conscious, limited-capacity, high-effort | Manages complex tasks: solving a math problem, evaluating a complex argument, parallel parking           | **The intended corrector of bias**. Its job is to audit, question, and override the flawed impulses of System 1, but it is "lazy" and easily fatigued. |
