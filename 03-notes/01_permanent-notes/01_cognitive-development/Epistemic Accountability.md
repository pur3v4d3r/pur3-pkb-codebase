> [!principle-point]
> **The [[Epistemic Accountability]] and Social Binding Problem**
>
> Individual debiasing attempts often fail because people lack sufficient motivation to invest cognitive effort in overriding intuitive judgments. The solution lies in creating **epistemic accountability**—social structures that make belief quality consequential.[^13]
>
> [[Epistemic Accountability]] differs from moral accountability. While moral accountability involves blame, resentment, and punishment for violations of ethical norms, epistemic accountability involves **reduction of credibility and trust** for violations of evidential standards. When someone consistently makes poorly-justified claims, we don't necessarily blame them morally, but we do reduce the credence we give to their future assertions.
>
> Checkpoint systems leverage this by creating **public commitments** and **forecasting records**. Philip Tetlock's research on [[Superforecasting]] demonstrates that requiring people to make explicit, falsifiable predictions and then tracking their accuracy over time dramatically improves judgment quality.[^14] The accountability comes not from punishment but from the desire to maintain epistemic credibility—to be someone whose judgments are worth taking seriously.
>
> [[Decision Journal|Decision journaling]], [[Pre-Mortem Analysis]] conducted in teams, and [[Epistemic Spot Check|epistemic spot checks]] all create accountability structures by making reasoning visible and creating records that can be evaluated against outcomes. This external scaffolding compensates for the limited internal motivation to debias.
