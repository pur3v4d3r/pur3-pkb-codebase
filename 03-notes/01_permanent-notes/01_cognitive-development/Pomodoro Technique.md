> # **Pomodoro Applications in Self-Education**
> 
> **Reading Dense Academic Material**:
> - Pomodoro 1: Read 10 pages with highlighting
> - Break: Reflect on key ideas
> - Pomodoro 2: Create permanent notes on highlights
> - Break: Physical movement
> - Pomodoro 3: Link new notes to existing knowledge
> - Break: Mental rest

> **Modified Pomodoros for Flow Work**:
> Many practitioners adapt intervals (50/10 for deeper work, 15/5 for administrative tasks) based on task demands. The rigid 25/5 structure is a starting point, not a universal law.
