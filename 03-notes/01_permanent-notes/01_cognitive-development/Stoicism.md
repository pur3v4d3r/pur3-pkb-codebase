## Key Principles
> Stoicism offers a practical framework for living a good life, focusing on what is within our control and accepting what is not.
1. `Virtue as the Only Good`
	1. **Four Cardinal Virtues:** Stoics believe that true happiness (eudaimonia) comes from living a virtuous life. These virtues are:
		1. **Wisdom:** The ability to navigate complex situations, make sound judgments, and understand what is good, bad, and indifferent
		2. **Courage:** Facing adversity, uncertainty, and fear with resolve, standing up for what is right.
		3. **Justice:** Treating others fairly and with kindness, fulfilling one's duties to humanity.
		4. **Temperance (Self-Discipline):** Exercising moderation and self-control over desires and impulses.
2. `Living in Accordance with Nature`
	1. Stoics believed that the universe is governed by an intelligent, rational principle (Logos or God). To "live in accordance with nature" means to live in accordance with reason, understanding our place in the cosmos, and fulfilling our human potential through virtue.
3. `Dichotomy of Control`
	1. Perhaps the most foundational Stoic principle, it teaches us to distinguish between what is **within our control** and what is **outside our control**.
		1. **Within our control:** Our opinions, judgments, desires, aversions, and actions (our volitions).
		2. **Outside our control:** Our body, property, reputation, external events, other people's actions, health, wealth, and death.
	2. Focusing our energy on what we *can* control leads to tranquility; fretting over what we *cannot* control leads to frustration and unhappiness.
4. `Acceptance (Amor Fati)`
	1. "Love of fate." This principle encourages us to not merely accept, but to *embrace* everything that happens, seeing it as a necessary part of the rational unfolding of the universe. It means wishing for things to be precisely as they are.
5. `Premeditatio Malorum`
	1. "Premeditation of evils." This practice involves contemplating potential future misfortunes (loss, illness, death, poverty). By mentally rehearsing these events, one can reduce their emotional impact if they occur and appreciate the good things one has in the present.
6. `Memento Mori`
	1. "Remember that you must die." This reflection on mortality serves as a powerful motivator to live virtuously and purposefully in the present, recognizing the fleeting nature of life and external possessions.

## Notable Stoic Thinkers

*   **Epictetus (c. 50 – 135 AD):** A former slave whose teachings emphasized the dichotomy of control and the importance of our inner freedom. His philosophy is preserved in the *Discourses* and the *Enchiridion* (Handbook).
*   **Seneca the Younger (c. 4 BC – 65 AD):** A Roman statesman, playwright, and advisor to Emperor Nero. His works, particularly his *Letters from a Stoic*, offer practical advice on living a good life, coping with grief, and managing anger.
*   **Marcus Aurelius (121 – 180 AD):** Roman Emperor and the last of the "Five Good Emperors." His personal reflections, known as *Meditations*, offer an intimate look at his struggles to live by Stoic principles while wielding immense power.

## Conclusion

Stoicism remains remarkably relevant in the modern world. Its focus on cultivating inner strength, emotional resilience, and a clear understanding of what is truly important provides a robust framework for navigating the challenges of life, fostering tranquility, purpose, and enduring happiness. It teaches us that while we cannot control external events, we always control our response to them.
