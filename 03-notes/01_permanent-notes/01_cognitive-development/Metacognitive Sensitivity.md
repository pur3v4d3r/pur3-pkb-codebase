> [!definition]
> - **Key Term:** [[Metacognitive Sensitivity|Metacognitive Sensitivity vs. Metacognitive Bias]]
>     - These represent two orthogonal dimensions of metacognitive accuracy. **Metacognitive sensitivity** (also called type-2 sensitivity or discrimination) measures how well your confidence ratings separate correct from incorrect responses—when you're confident, are you more likely to be right? A person with high sensitivity issues confidence ratings that are tightly coupled with accuracy. **Metacognitive bias** (also called type-2 bias, calibration, or over/underconfidence) measures the overall level of your confidence judgments relative to your actual performance—independent of sensitivity. You could have perfect sensitivity (confidence always predicts accuracy) but terrible bias (you're systematically $30$ percentage points overconfident). Both dimensions must be addressed in a complete measurement system.
