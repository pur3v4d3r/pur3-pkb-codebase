> - **Definition:** The active, "**in-the-moment**" executive process of steering one's own mind. It is a continuous, three-part cycle: **Planning** (selecting goals and strategies before a task), **Monitoring** (real-time awareness of one's performance and comprehension *during* a task), and **Evaluating** (reflecting on the process and outcome *after* a task to update future behavior).

# Metacognitive Regulation: The Procedural Engine

> While metacognitive knowledge provides declarative foundations, **[[Metacognitive Regulation]]** encompasses the active processes through which individuals plan, monitor, and evaluate their cognitive activities. This regulatory dimension transforms passive knowledge into active control, enabling goal-directed cognition.

**Planning** involves selecting appropriate strategies, allocating resources, ordering actions, and establishing criteria for success before engaging in cognitive tasks. Expert learners demonstrate sophisticated planning: they analyze task demands, activate relevant prior knowledge, set proximal goals, and strategically sequence actions. Novices often plunge into tasks without planning, resulting in inefficient resource use and lower performance. Research on problem-solving shows that experts invest proportionally more time in planning phases than novices, yet complete tasks faster overall because effective planning reduces trial-and-error and dead-end pursuit.

**Monitoring** comprises ongoing awareness of comprehension, progress toward goals, and effectiveness of strategies during cognitive activity. This real-time assessment enables adaptive responding—slowing down when material proves difficult, backtracking when comprehension breaks down, or switching strategies when progress stalls. The accuracy of metacognitive monitoring predicts learning outcomes across domains: students with accurate monitoring adjust study time appropriately, focus on weakly learned material, and recognize when they've achieved mastery. Monitoring occurs at multiple timescales, from moment-to-moment comprehension checking during reading to hourly assessment of progress through a study session to daily evaluation of learning trajectory.

**Evaluation** involves retrospective assessment of cognitive products and processes after task completion. Did I achieve my learning goals? Were my strategies effective? What would I do differently next time? This reflective component feeds forward into planning for subsequent tasks, closing the feedback loop. Research on [[Reflection|reflective practice]] demonstrates that systematic evaluation distinguishes experts from experienced non-experts—both may accumulate extensive practice, but only reflective practitioners learn optimally from experience because they systematically analyze successes and failures.
