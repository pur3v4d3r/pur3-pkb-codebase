# Critical Thinking

> [!definition]
> - **Key-Term**:[[Critical Thinking]]
> - [**Definition**:Purposeful, self-regulatory judgment" involving interpretation, analysis, evaluation, inference, explanation, and self-regulation.]

> [!key]
> - Genuine critical thinkers develop metacognitive habits of deliberately seeking disconfirming evidence, considering alternative interpretations, and questioning their own assumptions with the same rigor they apply to others' thinking.


> [!key-claim]
> # **Metacognition provides the psychological infrastructure for critical thinking**
> 
> While [[Critical Thinking]] frameworks specify *what* skilled thinking looks like—the standards, dispositions, and cognitive operations characterizing effective reasoning—they rarely explain *how* thinkers achieve these standards psychologically. Metacognition answers this question: critical thinking emerges when metacognitive awareness and regulation are deployed specifically toward evaluating reasoning quality, assessing evidence, identifying assumptions, and detecting fallacies.
> > [!evidence]
> > **Interpretation** requires metacognitive awareness to recognize when understanding remains incomplete, prompting clarification-seeking. Without monitoring comprehension accuracy, thinkers mistake their interpretation for objective meaning, failing to consider alternative readings.
> > 
> > **Analysis** demands metacognitive planning to systematically decompose arguments into premises and conclusions, identify assumptions, and trace logical relationships. This systematic decomposition doesn't occur spontaneously but requires deliberate metacognitive control directing attention methodically through argument structure.
> > 
> > **Evaluation** epitomizes metacognitive regulation—assessing whether evidence supports claims, whether reasoning follows validly, whether sources prove credible. Each judgment requires metacognitive monitoring of one's own reasoning process: "Have I considered alternative explanations?" "Am I being influenced by confirmation bias?" "Is my standard of evidence appropriately stringent for this claim?"
> > 
> > **Inference** involves recognizing what conclusions evidence supports and how strongly. Skilled inference requires metacognitive awareness of inferential strength gradations (deductive certainty versus probabilistic support) and monitoring whether one's confidence calibrates accurately with evidence quality.
> > 
> > **Explanation** demands metacognitive capacity to externalize one's reasoning, making implicit thought processes explicit for others. Effective explanation requires monitoring whether the audience likely follows one's logic and adjusting presentation accordingly—an intrinsically metacognitive operation.
> > 
> > **Self-regulation** explicitly names metacognitive regulation as a critical thinking component. [[Facione]] describes this as self-consciously monitoring one's cognitive activities, recognizing elements used in those activities, and applying skills in analysis and evaluation to one's own inferential judgments—a direct description of metacognitive operations applied to one's own reasoning.
