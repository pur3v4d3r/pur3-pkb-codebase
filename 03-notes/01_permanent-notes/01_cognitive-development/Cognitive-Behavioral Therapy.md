## Foundational Understanding
### What is CBT?

> [!answer]
> CBT is a talking therapy that aims to solve problems concerning dysfunctional emotions, behaviors, and cognitions through a goal-oriented, systematic procedure. It teaches clients practical self-help strategies that are useful in their daily lives. The therapy is collaborative, where the client and therapist work together to understand the problems and develop effective coping mechanisms.


## Key Principles
CBT is built upon several foundational principles:

1. **Cognitive Principle:** Our thoughts significantly influence our emotions and behaviors.
2. **Behavioral Principle:** Our behaviors can influence our thoughts and emotions.
3. **Empiricism:** Encourages clients to view their thoughts and beliefs as hypotheses to be tested rather than absolute truths.
4. **Present-Focused:** While past experiences may be discussed for context, the primary focus is on current problems and developing solutions.
5. **Problem-Oriented:** Aims to address specific, clearly defined problems with concrete strategies.
6. **Time-Limited:** Often structured and completed within a specific timeframe, rather than being open-ended.
7. **Collaborative:** The client and therapist work as a team, with the client playing an active role in their recovery.
8. **Educational:** Teaches clients skills and strategies to become their own therapists, enabling long-term self-management.
