1. **Draft Status**: 
	1. Newly created components that haven't been tested in real workflows. 
2. **Experimental Status**: 
	1. Components that have basic testing but aren't yet proven across diverse use cases.
3. **Stable Status**: 
	1. Components with proven effectiveness across multiple uses. 
4. **Deprecated Status**: 
	1. Components that are being phased out, either because they've been superseded by better alternatives or because they rely on techniques that no longer work with current models.
5. **Archived Status**: 
	1. Deprecated components that have been moved out of the active library after their deprecation period.
