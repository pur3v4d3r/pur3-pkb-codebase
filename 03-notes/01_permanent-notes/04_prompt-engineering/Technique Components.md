> [!definition]
> - **Key-Term**:: [[Technique Components]]
> - [**Definition**:: encode [[Prompt Engineering Patterns]] that modify *how* Claude approaches tasks. These components implement methodologies like [[Chain-of-Thought]] ("Think step-by-step, showing your work at each stage"), [[Self-Consistency]] ("Generate three independent answers, then synthesize"), [[Tree-of-Thoughts]] ("Explore multiple reasoning paths and evaluate their promise"), or [[Reflexion]] ("After generating an answer, critique it and generate an improved version").]

**Technique components** are *highly reusable across domains*. The *same chain-of-thought* component can enhance **mathematical problem-solving**, **logical reasoning**, **code debugging**, or **essay analysis**. 

> These components represent accumulated wisdom about what prompting strategies reliably improve output quality. 

As the field of prompt engineering *evolves*, your **technique component library** should **expand** with newly *discovered patterns* while deprecating techniques that stop working as models improve.

> [!key-claim]
> **Central Principle**
> Technique components are where you capture meta-knowledge about *how to use Claude effectively*, making them among your most valuable components. A well-maintained technique library represents your evolving expertise in prompt engineering itself, independent of any specific domain or task.

> [!connections-and-links]
> - [[atomic-notes_moc]]: This is a link to the *Main Hub* for all **Atomic Notes**, from there you will find sections of each of the various *Subjects* I have been **working on**.
