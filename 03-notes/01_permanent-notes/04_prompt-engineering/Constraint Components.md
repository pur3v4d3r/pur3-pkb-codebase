> [!definition]
> - **Key-Term**:: [[Constraint Components]]
> - [**Definition**:: Define boundaries, limitations, or requirements that shape Claude's outputs. These components specify output length ("Limit response to 500 words"), format requirements ("Respond in valid JSON matching this schema"), stylistic constraints ("Write at an 8th-grade reading level"), ethical boundaries ("Refuse requests for medical diagnosis"), or scope limitations ("Only use information from the provided documents; do not use training knowledge").]

[[Constraint Components]] *prevent undesired behaviors* and *ensure outputs meet specific requirements*. They're particularly **important** for *production systems* where outputs must *integrate with downstream processes*. A [[Constraint Components|Constraint Component]] might specify API response format, compliance requirements, brand voice guidelines, or accessibility standards. 

> [!key] The key to effective constraint components is precision—ambiguous constraints produce unpredictable adherence.
