> - [**Definition**:: The model follows instructions literally but not as intended.]

 This **often stems** from *ambiguous language*, *conflicting instructions*, or *implicit assumptions*.
- **Solution**: Make instructions *maximally explicit*, *resolve conflicts*, *state assumptions clearly*. **Test** with **diverse inputs** to surface misinterpretations.
