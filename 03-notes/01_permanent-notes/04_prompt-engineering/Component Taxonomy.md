> [!definition]
> - **Key-Term**:: [[Component Taxonomy]]
> - [**Definition**:: A hierarchical classification system that categorizes prompt components by their functional role, semantic purpose, and compositional behavior. The taxonomy provides a shared vocabulary for discussing components and establishes organizational principles that guide both human navigation and AI-assisted discovery.]

The foundational **taxonomy** divides components into **five primary categories**, each *serving a distinct purpose* in prompt construction. Understanding these categories is essential for effective component design and composition.

1. [[Role Components]]
2. [[Task Specification Components]]
3. [[Technique Components]]
4. [[Constraint Components]]
5. [[Output Format Components]]
