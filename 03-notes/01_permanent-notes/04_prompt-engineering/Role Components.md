> [!definition]
> - **Key-Term**:: [[Role Components]]
> - [**Definition**:: establish Claude's identity and expertise for an interaction. These components answer the question "Who is Claude pretending to be?" and prime Claude's responses by invoking specific knowledge domains and communication styles. A role component might define Claude as a "Senior DevOps Engineer," "Research Librarian," "Science Educator," or "Legal Document Analyst." Well-crafted role components include not just the title but also relevant background, expertise markers, communication style preferences, and ethical constraints specific to that role.]

The power of role components lies in their ability to activate Claude's **latent knowledge**. When you *invoke the "Quantum Physics Professor" role*, you're not *teaching* Claude quantum physics—**you're directing it to draw from that portion of its training data** and to **communicate with the pedagogical clarity** appropriate to a **professor**.

>Role components:
>  1. Should specify depth of expertise (beginner-friendly vs. expert-level)
>  2. Communication style (formal vs. conversational, technical vs. accessible)
>  3. Any role-specific constraints (a medical role might emphasize evidence-based practice and appropriate disclaimers).
