> [!definition]
> - **Key-Term**:: [[Claude Opus 4]]
> - [**Definition**:: Opus models are engineered for tasks requiring maximum computational depth, though [[Claude Sonnet 4.5|Sonnet 4.5]] has largely superseded earlier Opus versions in practical applications.]

> [!evidence]
> The architectural distinction lies in how these models allocate computational resources during inference.
> - [[Claude Opus 4|Opus]] prioritizes depth and exhaustiveness.
> - [[Claude Sonnet 4.5|Sonnet]] optimizes for speed without sacrificing reasoning quality.
