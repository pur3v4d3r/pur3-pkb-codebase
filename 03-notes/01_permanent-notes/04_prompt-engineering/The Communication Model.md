> [!definition]
> - **Key-Term**:: [[The Communication Model]]
> - [**Definition**:: [[Prompt Engineering]] represents a specialized form of communication where the audience (the [[Large Language Models|LLM]]) has specific characteristics:
> 	1. Vast knowledge but limited reasoning ability.
> 	2. Sensitivity to phrasing but no true understanding.
> 	3. Capacity for pattern matching but no genuine comprehension of meaning.]

Effective prompts communicate clearly despite these characteristics, employing *redundancy* for **critical information**, *explicit structure* for **complex tasks**, and *clear examples* when **abstract descriptions** might prove **ambiguous**.
