> [!definition]
> - **Key-Term**:: [[Anthropic]]
> - [**Definition**:: Anthropic PBC is the name of the AI research and development company that created the Claude family of large language models (LLMs).
>   - **The Name's Origin**: The name "Anthropic" comes from the Greek word anthrōpikós, meaning "of or relating to human beings". The name reflects the company's mission to build AI systems that are safe, reliable, and aligned with human values.
>   - **The Approach (Constitutional AI)**: Anthropic is known for its strong focus on AI safety and ethics, particularly its development of a training method called Constitutional AI (CAI). This framework uses a set of ethical principles (a "constitution") to guide the AI's behavior, making it more "helpful, honest, and harmless" without relying solely on extensive human supervision.
>   - **Human-Centric Goal**: The company's overall purpose is the responsible development of advanced AI for the long-term benefit of humanity, emphasizing interpretability and steerability of AI systems to ensure they can be understood and controlled by humans.]
