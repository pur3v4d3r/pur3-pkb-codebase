> [!definition]
> - **Key-Term**:: [[Prompt Engineering]]
> - [**Definition**:: The systematic practice of designing, structuring, and optimizing input queries (prompts) to [[Large Language Models]] to achieve specific, desired outputs with maximum accuracy, relevance, and consistency.]

> [!quick-reference]
> **Basic Prompting Best Practices**
> - 🔑 **Be Specific**: Specificity minimizes ambiguity, allowing the AI to understand the request's context and nuance
> - 🔑 **Provide Context**: Background information dramatically improves relevance and quality
> - 🔑 **Use Examples**: Demonstrations clarify expectations more effectively than descriptions alone
> - 🔑 **State Positively**: Specify what to do rather than what not to do
> - 🔑 **Format Clearly**: Use separators and structure to distinguish prompt components
> - 🔑 **Iterate Systematically**: Test variations and measure outcomes rather than guessing

> [!connections-and-links]
> - [[atomic-notes_moc]]: This is a link to the *Main Hub* for all **Atomic Notes**, from there you will find sections of each of the various *Subjects* I have been **working on**.
