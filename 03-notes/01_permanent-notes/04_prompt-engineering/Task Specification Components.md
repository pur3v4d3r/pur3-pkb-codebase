> [!definition]
> - **Key-Term**:: [[Task Specification Components]]
> - [**Definition**:: Define what Claude should accomplish. These components move from abstract role to concrete objective, detailing the specific work product, analysis, or output Claude should produce. Task components range from simple directives ("Summarize this article in three paragraphs") to complex, multi-stage workflows ("Analyze this dataset: first identify patterns, then formulate hypotheses, then suggest experimental designs to test those hypotheses").]

>Effective task components exhibit three qualities:
> 1. Specificity (vague tasks produce vague outputs)
> 2. Decomposition (complex tasks should break into explicit stages)
> 3. Success criteria (defining what "good" looks like). 

A sophisticated **task component** might specify:
- **Intermediate outputs** ("*First produce an outline, then wait for approval before drafting*")
- **Quality thresholds** ("*Include at least three citations from peer-reviewed sources*"), 
- **Iterative refinement procedures** ("*Generate three alternative approaches, then recommend the best one with justification*").
