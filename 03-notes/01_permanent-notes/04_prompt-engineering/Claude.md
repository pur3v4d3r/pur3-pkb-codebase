> [!definition]
> - **Key-Term**:: [[03-notes/01_permanent-notes/04_prompt-engineering/Claude]]
> - [**Definition**:: Claude is a family of large language models (LLMs) developed by [[Anthropic]], designed with an emphasis on [[Constitutional Ai]], safety, and helpfulness. Claude models are trained using [[Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback]] (RLHF) with a constitution of ethical principles, making them particularly adept at nuanced reasoning, following complex instructions, and maintaining contextual awareness over extended conversations.]

>[!important] Key aspects of Claude include:
> - **Developer**: Anthropic, an AI safety and research company founded by former OpenAI researchers.
> - **Constitutional AI**: Claude uses "Constitutional AI." This approach allows the model to assess its own responses against ethical principles to reduce harmful or biased outputs.
> - **Model Family**: Anthropic offers models with different capabilities and costs, such as the Claude 3 and Claude 4 families. These families have models such as Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus.
> - **Multimodal Capabilities**: Newer Claude models can analyze both text and images.
> - **Large Context Window**: Claude models can handle large prompts and documents. Context windows are typically around 200,000 tokens. Some versions can handle up to 1 million tokens.
> - **Applications**: Claude is used for customer service, legal document analysis, coding assistance, research, and creative writing.
>   
>   
> Claude is an AI designed to perform complex, long-context tasks effectively.

### The Claude Model Family

Claude represents a tiered approach to [[Ai Capabilities]], with each model optimized for different use cases. The current Claude 4 family architecture demonstrates Anthropic's progression toward more sophisticated reasoning while maintaining efficiency.

**Claude Sonnet 4.5** represents the pinnacle of the current generation, balancing exceptional intelligence with operational efficiency. This model excels at complex reasoning tasks, extended context management, and sophisticated instruction following. It processes information with a level of nuance that approaches expert-level human analysis in many domains. The "Sonnet" designation historically indicated a mid-tier balance, but 4.5 has evolved to represent the smartest general-purpose model in the family.

**Claude Opus 4** and **4.1** occupy specialized positions in the hierarchy. Opus models are engineered for tasks requiring maximum computational depth, though Sonnet 4.5 has largely superseded earlier Opus versions in practical applications. The architectural distinction lies in how these models allocate computational resources during inference—Opus prioritizes depth and exhaustiveness, while Sonnet optimizes for speed without sacrificing reasoning quality.

**Claude Haiku** (when available in a generation) represents the efficiency-focused tier, designed for high-throughput applications where speed and cost-effectiveness are paramount. Haiku maintains core Claude capabilities while operating with reduced latency and computational overhead.

> [!key-claim]
> **Central Principle of Claude Architecture**
> Claude's design philosophy centers on "[[Constitutional Ai]]"—the model is trained not just to be capable, but to be helpful, harmless, and honest according to a predefined set of principles. This makes Claude particularly responsive to structured, principle-based prompting and explicit value alignment in instructions.
