> [!definition]
> - **Key-Term**:: [[The Scaffolding Model]]
> - [**Definition**:: [[Scaffolding-(Constructivist-Learning)|Scaffolding]] provides *structure* that guides *model behavior* through carefully designed **constraints and frameworks**, similar to how *construction scaffolding* supports *building* work.]
 
- Complex prompts function as **intellectual** [[Scaffolding-(Constructivist-Learning)|scaffolding]] that supports *reasoning processes* the model **couldn't** execute **without structural support**.

- Chain-of-thought prompts [[Scaffolding-(Constructivist-Learning)|scaffold]] step-by-step reasoning, few-shot examples [[Scaffolding-(Constructivist-Learning)|scaffold]] format understanding, explicit constraints [[Scaffolding-(Constructivist-Learning)|scaffold]] boundary awareness. The [[Scaffolding-(Constructivist-Learning)|scaffolding]] doesn't do the work but makes the work possible.
