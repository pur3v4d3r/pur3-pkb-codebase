[[Zero-Shot Prompting]] proves most effective for tasks that align closely with common patterns in the model's training data. *Simple information retrieval*, *basic question answering*, *straightforward text transformations* (like *translation* or *summarization*), and *other frequently-encountered tasks* **typically perform well with zero-shot approaches**. The **key** advantage lies in **efficiency**—zero-shot prompts require minimal engineering effort and can be deployed rapidly for exploratory purposes or quick prototyping.

However, [[Zero-Shot Prompting]] exhibits clear limitations for complex or nuanced tasks. Zero-shot prompting is limited for complex tasks, and few-shot prompting can provide demonstrations to steer the model to better performance. When tasks involve specialized formatting, domain-specific conventions, or subtle distinctions that may not be well-represented in training data, zero-shot approaches often produce inconsistent or suboptimal results. In such cases, more sophisticated techniques become necessary.
