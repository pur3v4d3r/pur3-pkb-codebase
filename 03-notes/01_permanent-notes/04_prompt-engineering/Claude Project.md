> [!definition]
> - **Key-Term**:: [[Claude Project]]
> - [**Definition**:: is a self-contained, customized workspace within the Anthropic [[03-notes/01_permanent-notes/04_prompt-engineering/Claude]] AI platform (available on paid plans) designed for focused, ongoing tasks or workflows. It functions like an "intelligent folder" where all relevant information and instructions are stored and applied to every conversation within that specific environment.]

>[!important] Key components and features of a Claude Project:
> - **Custom Instructions**: A persistent, global prompt defines how Claude should behave, its tone of voice, output format, and specific guidelines for all interactions within the project. This eliminates the need to repeatedly provide the same context in every prompt.
> - **Focused Chat History**: All conversations related to a specific task are kept in one place, preventing clutter and helping Claude maintain context across interactions.
> - **Team Collaboration**: Users on Team and Enterprise plans can share projects with team members, enabling collaborative workflows with different permission levels (can use or can edit).
> - **Persistent Context**: The project's information, including the knowledge base and instructions, is consistently available to Claude, allowing it to act as a subject matter expert tailored to the specific project's needs. 
> 
> 
> In essence, a [[Claude Project]] allows users to create a specialized, highly effective AI assistant for a specific purpose, such as writing content briefs, analyzing code, or managing HR applications, by providing it with a curated knowledge set and clear instructions.
