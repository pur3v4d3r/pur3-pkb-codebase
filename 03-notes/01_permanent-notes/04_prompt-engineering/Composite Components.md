A [[Role Components|Role]] [[Composite Components|Composite Component]] might combine *role definition*, *expertise specification*, *communication style*, and *ethical constraints* into a **single** "**Senior Python Developer**" component that's ready to use without additional assembly.

> [[Composite Components]] sacrifice some flexibility for convenience—they're faster to deploy but harder to customize.

> [!analogy]
> **Illuminating Comparison**
> Think of atomic vs. composite components like LEGO bricks vs. pre-assembled LEGO structures. Individual bricks (atomic components) offer unlimited creative possibilities but require time and skill to assemble into something functional. Pre-assembled structures (composite components) provide immediate utility but limit customization. Serious LEGO builders maintain both a vast collection of individual bricks for custom creations and a library of pre-built subassemblies for common structures they use repeatedly.
