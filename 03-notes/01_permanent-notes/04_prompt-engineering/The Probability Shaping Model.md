> [!definition]
> - **Key-Term**:: [[The Probability Shaping Model]]
> - [**Definition**:: The model responds with what it determines is most likely given its training data—understanding this probabilistic foundation means recognizing that prompts don't command the model to do things but rather shift probability distributions over possible outputs.]

 This mental model emphasizes that [[Prompt Engineering]] fundamentally involves probability management. **Every word**, **every structural choice**, **every example shifts the probability landscape**, making some outputs more likely and others less likely. Effective prompts *shape* these distributions to **concentrate probability mass** on *desired outcomes* while **dispersing** it from *undesired ones*.
