> [!definition]
> - **Key-Term**:: [[Prompt Template]]
> - [**Definition**:: a pre-defined structure with placeholders that can be filled with specific content to generate customized prompts for an AI model. These templates help create consistent, efficient, and clear instructions for the AI, ensuring more accurate and reliable outputs. They are used for tasks like generating jokes, summarizing text, or powering conversational agents, by making it easy to test different inputs or scale applications without rewriting entire prompts.]

> [!work-log-entry] How they work
> - **Structure**: A template defines the core structure of a prompt, which can include instructions, context, or rules for the AI.
> - **Placeholders**: Variables or placeholders, such as {topic} or {input_data}, are inserted into the template.
> - **Generation**: When a specific value is provided for the placeholder, the template is filled in to create a complete, ready-to-use prompt.
> - **Dynamic content**: This process allows for dynamic content generation, where the same template can be used to create many different prompts by changing the input values

>[!important] Benefits of using prompt templates
> - **Consistency**: Ensures that prompts for similar tasks have a uniform structure, leading to more reliable results.
> - **Efficiency**: Saves time and effort by providing a reusable framework for prompt creation.
> - **Clarity**: Helps in providing clear instructions to the AI model, which reduces ambiguity.
> - **Scalability**: Makes it easier to manage and generate a large number of prompts for various applications.
