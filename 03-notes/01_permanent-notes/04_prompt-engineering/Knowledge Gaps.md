 There are techniques to teach strategies for increasing accuracy and grounding of responses, **but** even with *effective prompt engineering*, **validation of model-generated responses remains necessary**.
 - **Solution**: *Provide necessary information* **directly** in the **prompt**, use **retrieval augmentation** to inject relevant context, or explicitly instruct the model to *acknowledge knowledge limitations*.
