> [!definition]
> - **Key-Term**:: [[Experimental Status]]
> - [**Definition**:: Components that have basic testing but aren't yet proven across diverse use cases. Experimental components have complete documentation and clear use cases but limited usage data. They're candidates for wider adoption but may still need refinement. Claude can suggest experimental components when they offer significant advantages over stable alternatives, always with appropriate caveats. Track experimental components carefully—those that perform well should graduate to stable status within 4-6 weeks.]
