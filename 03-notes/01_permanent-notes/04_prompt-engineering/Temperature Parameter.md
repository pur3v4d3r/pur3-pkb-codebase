> [!definition]
> - **Key-Term**:: [[Temperature Parameter]]
> - [**Definition**:: This is a statistical parameter used in machine learning, particularly in models like Boltzmann machines or when applying techniques like simulated annealing, to control the randomness or exploration-exploitation trade-off of the system; a higher temperature encourages more random exploration, while a lower temperature makes the system more deterministic and focused on exploitation of known good solutions.]
