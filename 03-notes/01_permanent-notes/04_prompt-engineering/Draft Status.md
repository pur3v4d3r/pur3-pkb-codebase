> [!definition]
> - **Key-Term**:: [[Draft Status]]
> - [**Definition**:: Newly created components that haven't been tested in real workflows. Draft components contain initial ideas and structures but may have incomplete documentation, unclear dependencies, or untested effectiveness. Claude should only suggest draft components when explicitly asked to include experimental options or when no stable alternatives exist. Draft components should be reviewed within two weeks of creation—either promoted to experimental status or deleted if they prove unpromising.]
