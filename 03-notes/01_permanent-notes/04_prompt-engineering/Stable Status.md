- [[Stable Status|Stable Status Components]] form the core of your library—these are *battle-tested*, *well-documented*, and *reliable*.

- Claude should default to suggesting [[Stable Status|Stable Status Components]] unless specific requirements call for [[Experimental Status]] alternatives.

- [[Stable Status|Stable Status Components]] still evolve (through MINOR and PATCH version updates) but their fundamental approach has proven sound.
