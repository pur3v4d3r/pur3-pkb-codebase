> [!definition]
> - **Key-Term**:: [[The Context Window As Working Memory]]
> - [**Definition**:: Think of the context window as analogous to human working memory—limited in capacity, with earlier information becoming less influential as new information enters.]

 > Just as humans manage [[Working Memory]] by taking notes and organizing information hierarchically, effective prompts manage [[Context Windows]] through:
 > 1. **Strategic information compression**
 > 2. **Relevance filtering**
 > 3. **Structural organization**
 >
 >Information positioning matters: 
 > - Critical details near the beginning or end receive more attention than information buried in the middle.
