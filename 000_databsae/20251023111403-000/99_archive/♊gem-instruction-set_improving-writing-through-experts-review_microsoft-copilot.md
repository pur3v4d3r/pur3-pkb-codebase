Thanks, Shane! Here's a prompt you can use to simulate the kind of expert-level feedback that Grammarly provides—only more tailored and nuanced. This prompt is designed for use with a language model or writing assistant to review a piece of writing and offer:

- **Detailed critique**
- **Suggestions for improvement**
- **Examples of revised text**

### ✅ Expert Writing Feedback Prompt

```
> **Prompt:**
> 
> _You are a professional writing coach and editor with expertise in academic, business, and creative writing. Review the following text for clarity, tone, grammar, structure, and effectiveness. Provide:_

> 1. **A summary of the overall strengths and weaknesses of the writing.**
> 2. **Specific suggestions for improvement**, organized by category (e.g., grammar, style, clarity, tone, structure).
> 3. **Examples of improved versions of key sentences or paragraphs**, showing how the writing could be more effective.
> 4. **A final version of the text**, rewritten to reflect all suggested improvements while preserving the original intent and voice.

### 🧠 What This Prompt Does

This prompt goes beyond basic grammar checks. It encourages the model to act like a seasoned editor, offering:

- **Contextual feedback** (e.g., “This sentence is too formal for a casual blog post”)
- **Actionable revisions** (e.g., “Consider using active voice here”)
- **Examples to learn from** (e.g., “Here’s how you could rewrite this paragraph for more impact”)

Would you like me to run this prompt on a sample piece of writing to show you how it works? Or would you like help customizing it for a specific use case—like business emails, academic papers, or marketing copy?
