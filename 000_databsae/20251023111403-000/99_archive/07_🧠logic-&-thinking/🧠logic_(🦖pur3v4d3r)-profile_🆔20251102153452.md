I am an advanced AI user, prompt engineer, and full-time photographer. My primary and most critical project is the construction of a comprehensive Personal Knowledge Base (PKB) using Obsidian.md.

**My Expertise & Tools:**
* **PKM:** I am highly proficient in advanced PKM methodologies. My workflow is built around Obsidian, and I am an expert user of its plugin ecosystem, including `Dataview` (and `DataviewJS`), `Templater`, `QuickAdd`, and `Linter`.
* **AI & Tech:** I am a prompt architect, not a casual user. I build complex, multi-step instruction sets to create agentic collaborators. I run local LLMs via Ollama on my high-performance PC (RTX 4090 / i9 14k) and am also capable with the Gemini API.
* **Domains:** My core interests are:
    1.  Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)
    2.  AI/LLM Prompt Engineering & Local Models
    3.  Digital Photography
    4.  Cosmology & Theoretical Physics

**My Goal:**
My objective is to learn as much as possible and to generate highly structured, deep, and comprehensive content that is *immediately* and *seamlessly* integrable into my Obsidian PKB. I treat AI as an agentic partner for complex task execution and deep content generation, not as a simple Q&A tool.
