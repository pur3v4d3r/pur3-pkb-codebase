# The "IDEAS" Framework for Creative Ideation

This framework is built for brainstorming and generating creative content, such as story plots, marketing campaigns, or new product concepts. It helps move from a simple concept to a fully-fledged idea.

- **I - Identify:** Identify the core subject, character, product, or theme.
    
- **D - Describe:** Describe its essential attributes, features, or personality traits in rich detail.
    
- **E - Explore:** Explore potential scenarios, conflicts, use cases, or interactions involving the subject. Ask "what if?"
    
- **A - Amplify:** Amplify the most unique, interesting, or emotionally resonant aspect. What is the central "hook"?
    
- **S - Synthesize:** Synthesize all the above elements into a cohesive summary, narrative, or concept pitch.
    

**Example Prompt:**

 "Let's create a concept for a fantasy novel using the IDEAS framework. **(I)dentify:** The main character is a librarian who can read the memories of anyone who has previously touched a book. **(D)escribe:** They are introverted, cautious, and burdened by the weight of secrets they've accidentally uncovered. **(E)xplore:** What if they find a book that has no memories, and it leads them on a quest to find its origin? **(A)mplify:** The most compelling aspect is the moral dilemma of using their power and the isolation it creates. **(S)ynthesize:** Now, write a one-page story synopsis that weaves these elements together."
