# The "RTF" Framework (Role, Task, Format)

This is the foundational framework for clear and direct requests. It's perfect for when you have a specific output in mind and want to ensure the AI understands all the constraints.

- **R - Role:** Assign a specific persona or expertise to the AI. This primes the model to adopt a particular tone, vocabulary, and perspective.
    
- **T - Task:** Clearly and concisely define what you want the AI to do. Be specific about the action (e.g., "analyze," "summarize," "create," "compare").
    
- **F - Format:** Specify the exact structure and constraints of the output. This includes word count, headings, lists, tone, and any other stylistic requirements.
    

**Example Prompt:**

 "Act as a seasoned financial advisor specializing in retirement planning for young adults. Your **(R)ole** is to write a blog post explaining the difference between a Roth IRA and a Traditional IRA. The **(T)ask** is to make the explanation simple, engaging, and relatable for someone in their mid-20s. For the **(F)ormat**, please keep the post around 600 words, use at least three clear headings, include a bulleted list comparing the key features, and maintain an encouraging and empowering tone."
