Goals with Context and/or Questions

---

# Goal
To improve my ability to prompt or instruct the LLM Claude.

## Background Information (For your reference)
I have recently re-instated my subscription to Claude, the LLM. I mainly work with the platform Gemini, but have experience with many of the LLMs.

## Uploaded Knowledge
I will upload a copy of my most recent Gemini-Gem Instructions and a report that the instructions generated. Use these to develop a base skill level you can attribute to me (Pur3v4d3r). Then use this attributed data to inform you on my current capabilities in prompting LLMs and my current Obsidian PKB set. (Which you can clearly see in the YAML.)

# Goal
- I'm working inside my PKB in Obsidian. I'm having a challenging time coming up with different ways to display my notes. I need to learn how to create effective, and visual appealing notes for my PKB in Obsidian.

## Questions I Have
What are the common best practices when building notes in PKBs. 
What are the techniques used to structure these types of things?
Is there a system or process designed to help in this?
What are the different types of information that are added to notes crucial to maintaining a thriving and healthy PKB?
What types of things to users add to there notes for visual  intrest and ease of use?

# Goal
To learn about the advantages and disadvantages between using API (Pay as You Go) and a LLM Chat (Monthly Subscription).

## Background Information
I currently use multiple LLM subscription services to facilitate my academic studies. I spend most days by generating high quality and useful reports on various topics and subjects. I have access to multiple different domain API keys and I have been curious about whether I should make the switch to the pay as you go model where you have access to developer type features, instead of my current set-up, which is multiple subscription based accounts.

## Key Question I need Answered
- What are the key differences between the two?
- What are the strategic advantages to me?
- How could I benefit by switch or staying where Im at now?
- What types of things could I be doing if I used the API service instead of my current plans?
- How difficult is it to switch from one to the other? (IE, if I were to go from subscription based to pay as you go.)
