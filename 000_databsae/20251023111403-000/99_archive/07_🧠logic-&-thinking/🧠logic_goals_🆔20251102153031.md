Goals

---

# Goal
My goal is to create a multi-model, advanced workflow that maximizes the **depth, accuracy, and educational value** of the research articles and reports I generate, ensuring everything contributes meaningfully to my PKB in Obsidian. **Quality is the paramount concern, always prevailing over quantity.**

---

# Goal
To reliably transform a high-level conceptual automation idea into a complete, executable, and fully documented workflow for an Obsidian Personal Knowledge Base (PKB). The output must include all necessary code/assets, a detailed implementation guide, a **visualization of the process flow**, and a comprehensive explanation of the engineering choices, **including integration into the PKB's existing Dataview and Tasks infrastructure.**

---

# Goal
- Create QuickAdd choices and QuickAdd choice's with synergies to my other plugins.
- Think of it like it's a brainstorming session that generates useful ideas, complete with the How to implement, and what it accomplishes Etc.
