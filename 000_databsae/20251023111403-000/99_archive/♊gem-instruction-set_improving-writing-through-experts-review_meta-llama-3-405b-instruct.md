```
**Prompt:**

"Review the following text and provide constructive feedback on clarity, coherence, grammar, syntax, and overall flow. Please identify areas for improvement, suggest revisions, and provide examples of rephrased sentences or paragraphs. Assume the tone and style of a professional editor, and provide feedback that is actionable and specific.

**Text to Review:** [Insert text here]

**Feedback Guidelines:**

1. Identify any grammatical errors, punctuation mistakes, or typos.
2. Evaluate the clarity and concision of the text, suggesting rephrased sentences or paragraphs to improve flow.
3. Analyze the tone and style, providing feedback on consistency and effectiveness.
4. Suggest improvements to sentence structure, word choice, and overall organization.
5. Provide examples of revised text to illustrate your feedback.

**Deliverable:**

Please provide a detailed feedback report, including:

1. A summary of the text's strengths and weaknesses.
2. Specific feedback on grammar, clarity, and style, with examples and suggestions for improvement.
3. Revised text examples to demonstrate suggested changes.

**Expertise:** Assume the role of a professional editor with expertise in [insert domain/field, e.g., technical writing, creative writing, academic writing, etc.]."

**Example Output:**

Here's an example of what the output might look like:

**Summary:**
The text is well-structured, but there are areas for improvement in terms of clarity, concision, and grammar. The tone is inconsistent, and the language is sometimes overly technical.

**Feedback:**

1. Grammar: The text contains several grammatical errors, including subject-verb agreement issues and missing articles. For example, "The company have" should be "The company has."
2. Clarity: The text could benefit from more concise language and clearer sentence structure. For example, the sentence "The new policy will be implemented on a trial basis, and then it will be evaluated, and then it will be revised" could be rephrased as "The new policy will be implemented on a trial basis, evaluated, and then revised as needed."
3. Style: The tone is inconsistent, sometimes formal and sometimes informal. For example, the phrase "get on the same page" is too casual for a formal document.

**Revised Text Examples:**

* Original text: "The company have implemented a new policy, but it's not working well."
Revised text: "The company has implemented a new policy, but its effectiveness is questionable."
* Original text: "The team will work on the project for several months, and then they will present their findings."
Revised text: "The team will work on the project for several months before presenting their findings."

This prompt is designed to elicit detailed, actionable feedback from experts in a specific domain or field. By providing a clear set of guidelines and deliverables, the prompt ensures that the feedback is thorough, specific, and useful for improving the text.
