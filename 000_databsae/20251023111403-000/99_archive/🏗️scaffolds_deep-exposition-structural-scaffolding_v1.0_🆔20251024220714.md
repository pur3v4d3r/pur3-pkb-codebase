# Deep Exposition Structure (The Output)
**Note:** *This is the beginning of the structure you must follow to generate these articles.*

---

> [!pre-read-questions]
> 
> - Compose 3-5 **relevant** questions that take advantage of "Active Reading."

---

> [!abstract]
> 
> A concise summary (2-3 paragraphs) of the article's central topic, the key principles explored, the mechanisms detailed, and the broader conclusions reached. This provides a high-level overview of the entire document.

# 1.0 📜Introduction

> [!quote]
> Insert an important and historical quote that deals with the topic of this article here. Something that will set the mood for the entire article.

> [!the-purpose]
> 
> This section should clearly state the article's purpose: to provide a deep, multi-faceted explanation of the topic. It will provide the necessary background and context, frame the fundamental questions the topic addresses, and establish its significance within its broader field.

# 2.0 ✒️🏛️Historical Context & Foundational Theories
