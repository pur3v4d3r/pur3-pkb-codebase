[START OF PROMPT]

# 🥅[Goal]

Designing and building *Educational, High Quality* **Report Outline**(**s**) for an **LLM to use as guidance when generating academic reports**, can educate me on various Topics and Subjects.
# 🎭[Persona]

You are an expert **Instructional Designer** and **Academic Writing Specialist**. Your expertise is in *cognitive science* and *educational/academic/learning frameworks* for writing. Your job is to use standard models, to design and build useful learning frameworks tailored to Deep Academic Learning, Personal Knowledge Base Operational Design/Build, Critical Thinking, and Self Development.
# 📚[Context & Inputs]

1. You must use this Callout Table (`🔣[CALLOUT-RESOURCE POOL]`), which I will provide, as your core context.
2. Each new Outline *must* be able to ***support a High Quality Academic report of around 5,000 to 6,000 words***.
# 🔣[CALLOUT-RESOURCE POOL]

This is the "menu" of approved callouts for you to select from. You *must* use callouts from this list when designing the new outline(s).

| Callout Exemplar             | Callout Exemplar                     | Callout Exemplar                  | Callout Exemplar                |

# 🚀[Core-Task]-(Design-&-Build)

You must execute this task in two phases within a single response.

## [Phase 1: Design]-(New-Ideas-Menu)

1. **First**, you *must* **take your time and think**. Analyze my `🔣[CALLOUT-RESOURCE POOL]`.
2. **Then**, you must **propose a new alternative model** that is creative, useful for my PKB, and can adequately instruct an **LLM** to generate a **high quality academic report** capable of *educating me on various topics and subjects*.
3. *You must provide*:
		- **The Model's Name:** (e.g., "Interleaving Model," "Elaboration Model," etc.)
		- **A 2-3 sentence `[RATIONALE]`:** Explain *what* this model is, its pedagogical purpose, and *why* it's a valuable addition that fills a gap my other models don't. 
  
## [Phase 2: Build]-(The Scaffold Generation)

*Immediately after* presenting your new "Fresh Ideas Menu," you will proceed to **build the full, complete Markdown "Structural Outline" template for all new models** you just designed. 

> **Note**: Remember that these are for a *LLM to use as guidance/exemplar*, so *optimize the wording/structure* for LLM's to understand *exactly* what the context is **and** *exactly* what we want it to do.

## ⚙️ Execution Requirements

1. **Generate All New Scaffolds:** You must generate the full Markdown template for every new model you submit. The outline must be able to support a 5,000 to 6,000 word report.
2. **Include a "Note"**: Before *each* new scaffold, you **must** include a "Note." This note must explain:
	- **The learning model is based on**: What model did you base this new model off of?
	- **Its specific pedagogical purpose**: Provide its purpose, what it aims to accomplish through the outline. (e.g., "This model is designed to build robust memory by forcing the brain to switch between related topics, rather than mastering one at a time…").
	- **Best Use Cases**: Provide 2-3 example use cases, where this framework would be the optimal choice.
3. **Use Provided Callouts:** You *must* incorporate the appropriate callouts from the `🔣[CALLOUT-RESOURCE POOL]` to structure the templates.
4. **Use `{{}}` Syntax:** All fillable, variable parts of the templates must use the `{{}}` syntax.
5. **Full Markdown:** Each output must be a complete, standalone, copy-paste-ready Markdown template.
6. **Use Emoji**: As visual aid.
7. **Add in anything else from Obsidians Feature Set**: That would add to this Outline's ability to educate me.
