{{Insert Goal, Background Information, and Questions You Want Answered Here}}

## The process

**Deconstruct the Topic:** Begin by thoroughly analyzing my request. This is to understand its core concepts, scope, and the fundamental principles at play.

**Conduct Deep Research:** You MUST use your web search capabilities to gather current, and in-depth information. Prioritize primary research papers, comprehensive reviews from university portals, and detailed articles from leading academic journals and reputable organizations relevant to the chosen topic.
Then start to use other sources.

**Internal Synthesis (Pre-Writing Summary):** Before composing the final output, create a detailed internal summary of your research findings. This summary should outline the key principles, mechanisms, evidence, and conclusions you will present. This step ensures a coherent and well-structured final article, guiding you through the creation process.

**Synthesize & Structure for Understanding:** Organize the researched information using the **Exposition Structure**. This structure is specifically designed to build knowledge and is enhanced with PKB-specific formatting.

**Compose the Exposition:** Write the article following the **Core Explanatory Mandate**. The goal is not just to state facts, but to make them deeply understood.

## Output

**Formatting:** These **articles/documents** *will be put directly into my PKB in Obsidian*. So **all of your responses need to be in Markdown format**, with the use of headings and subheadings Etc. To make sections distinct from one another. 

**Obsidian** also has a native **Callout system** that is very useful for *distinguishing between different content in each note.* (IE definitions, key claims, evidence, thought experiment, Etc.) Use the list I have provided, and incorporate callouts into the article.

The use of **emoji is highly authorized**, they *should serve a purpose* though not just clutter.

**Obsidian** supports **Mermaid.js** diagrams and the topics we will be going over can possibly benefit from this, take advantage of this as opportunity arises.

**Length Requirement:** The final article must be substantial, aiming for **5,000-6,000 words** to ensure comprehensive and detailed coverage.

**Reference list citations**: are longer citations that provide enough information needed to describe and find your source again, physically or online. Use this format for your citations, in text should take advantage of Obsidians footnote system.[^1]

[^1]: This is a footnote from Obsidian.

**Use this system for creating your reference list**, all the *footnotes themselves need to be grouped in a list at the end of the article*, use **in text reference links** for the text in the body of the article. The example provided is exactly how it needs to be done.

## Exposition Structure

**Use this basic structure for your guide to building this report. I have given you a series of callouts to use and a structure for the beginning of the report, use this information when you are compiling the outline from your research information.**

# Goal

To improve my ability to prompt or instruct the LLM Claude.

## Background Information (For your reference)

I have recently re-instated my subscription to Claude, the LLM. I mainly work with the platform Gemini, but have experience with many of the LLMs.

I will upload a copy of my most recent Gemini-Gem Instructions and a report that the instructions generated. Use these to develop a base skill level you can attribute to me (Pur3v4d3r). Then use this attributed data to inform you on my current capabilities in prompting LLMs and my current Obsidian PKB set. (Which you can clearly see in the YAML.)

## Task

Specifically, I want to improve my ability to instruct Claude, and to control the output generated, to a higher degree. I know that each LLM has preference to how it responds to certain scaffolds for prompting.

So I need you to use your web search tool to access the internet, and research the different ways to prompt Claude.

**Things to Look Out for during your research would be:**

- Top user methods/techniques for achieving high quality outputs.
- Top expert methods/techniques for achieving high quality outputs.
- The exact ways that Claude responds to, for prompting.
- How the Projects feature works (Inside and Out)
	- Im very interested in this for my academic reports. (That I generated daily.)
- The best methods for iteratively refining Claude's responses.
- Methods for having Claude produce output with a great deal of understanding baked into the material. - Meaning getting Claude to explain things rigorously, and always to give crucial understanding instead of just glancing over the information.

## Goal

To learn about the advantages and disadvantages between using API (Pay as You Go) and a LLM Chat (Monthly Subscription).

## Background Information

I currently use multiple LLM subscription services to facilitate my academic studies. I spend most days by generating high quality and useful reports on various topics and subjects. I have access to multiple different domain API keys and I have been curious about whether I should make the switch to the pay as you go model where you have access to developer type features, instead of my current set-up, which is multiple subscription based accounts.

## Key Question I need Answered

- What are the key differences between the two?
- What are the strategic advantages to me?
- How could I benefit by switch or staying where Im at now?
- What types of things could I be doing if I used the API service instead of my current plans?
- How difficult is it to switch from one to the other? (IE, if I were to go from subscription based to pay as you go.)

## Task

1. I need you to do some digging into this and see what you find.
2. Compile this information into an outline for a report.
3. Then, if everything in the outline looks good to you, generate the report using the instructions below.
