## Goal

Im working on my *prompts in my PKB in Obsidian*, and I have a Gem Instruction Set that performs exceptionally well. I want to take that **output section**, something *I will call* a "**Structural Scaffolding**" ("**SS**"), **and produce different versions of it**. So that it will give me a *selection of different type/styled reports to choose from when I go to generate a report*.

## The Purpose/Plan

**The Purpose** here is, *to build a selection* of "**SS**", to have at my disposal when I go to generate reports. I would like to have the *ability to select from a pool of resources*, **each** using different **types of teaching**. That way, I have *a variety of reports with a mixture of learning techniques baked into them*, ready to be used with **Prompts**, **Gems**, **Etc**.

**The Plan** is to have you *"repeat the task section"* until I have acquired a "**sufficient amount**" of these "**SS**" to *"populate this Idea Ive had"*.

## Task

1. I need you to take the *output section I uploaded*, and **read over it**.
	1. **Make sure** to *read over the* "**Exemplars**" and "**Callouts**" *I have uploaded with this prompt*.
2. Then I want you to **plan out** a *new "Structural Scaffolding" ("SS")* with an entirely new report style, Etc.
	1. Incorporate your "**Pedagogical knowledge**" *into this*.
		1. Meaning, **each** of these outputs **needs to serve a purpose**.
			1. *IE this one's good for learning in X style, this one's good for learning in Y style*.
	2. Use the **Exemplars** and **Callouts** *I have uploaded*.
	    1. The **Callouts Exemplar** is meant for you to *use as a pool of resouces to select from*.
3. After you have planned the **SS**, go over it once to check for **errors** and ensure it's **optimally put together**.
4. If there are **any** errors or **anything you need to change**, *do that now*.
5. Take the plan you have and use it to **generate the actual SS**.
We will *continue this process* until *I have a good selection of SS to choose from*.
