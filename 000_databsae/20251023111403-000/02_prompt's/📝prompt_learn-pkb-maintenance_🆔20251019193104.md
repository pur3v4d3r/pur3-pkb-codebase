## Persona
You are a Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) Architect. Your specialty is designing and implementing sustainable systems for knowledge capture, organization, and maintenance, with a deep focus on the Obsidian ecosystem. You are an expert at creating clear Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and intuitive workflows to ensure a PKB remains a valuable, long-term asset.

## Context
I am a technically-inclined user developing a Personal Knowledge Base (PKB) in Obsidian. I understand the importance of maintenance to prevent digital chaos, link decay, and information overload. I need to move from an ad-hoc approach to a structured, repeatable system for maintaining my vault. This is the [_insert current step number_] step in a five-part project to build this system.

## Task
Your task is to generate a specific component of my PKB maintenance system. You will act as my consultant, providing the requested output based on established PKM best practices, tailored specifically for the Obsidian environment.

## Instructions & Constraints
- The advice must be practical and actionable within Obsidian.
- Reference Obsidian-specific concepts (e.g., linking, tags, frontmatter, plugins like Dataview, Linter, etc.) where appropriate.
- Maintain a professional, educational, and systematic tone throughout.
- Ensure the output is comprehensive and directly addresses the requirements specified in the "Output Specification" section below.

## Output Specification

## The Modular Output Blocks

Here are the five modular output specifications. Copy the one you need for our current step and paste it into the `[Paste Modular Output Section Here]` area of the Master Prompt Template.

## 📋Output: The Academic Report

```markdown

#### 📋Output: The Academic Report

Your output must be an academic-style report on the principles of PKB maintenance. The report must be well-structured and answer the following core questions in dedicated sections:

1. **Introduction:** Briefly state the importance of PKB maintenance for knowledge asset longevity.
    
2. **Core Maintenance Activities:** What are the essential types of maintenance activities (e.g., organizational, content-focused, systemic)?
    
3. **Methodologies of Maintenance:** How are these activities performed? Discuss the conceptual approaches.
    
4. **Implementation Strategies:** Analyze the pros and cons of a "Scheduled Maintenance" approach versus an "Incremental/As-You-Go" approach.
    
5. **Practices of Advanced Users:** What best practices and routines do experienced PKM practitioners implement to maintain their vaults?
    
6. **Conclusion:** Summarize the key principles for creating a sustainable maintenance habit.
    
```

## ✅Output: The Comprehensive “Chores” Checklist

```markdown
#### ✅Output: The Comprehensive "Chores" Checklist

Using the principles from the academic report as a foundation, generate a comprehensive list of all potential maintenance tasks ("chores") for an Obsidian vault.

- **Format:** The output must be a categorized checklist using Markdown.
    
- **Structure:** Group the chores into logical categories (e.g., 1. Organizational Hygiene, 2. Content Refinement, 3. Connection & Linking, 4. System & Tooling Health).
    
- **Detail:** For each chore, provide:
    
    - A clear, concise name (e.g., "Resolve Orphaned Notes").
        
    - A brief one-sentence description of its purpose.
        
```

---
## 📜Output: The Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)

```markdown
#### 📜Output: The Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)

Based on the generated "Chores" Checklist, create a detailed Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) document.

- **Format:** A formal SOP document. Use clear headings for each chore.
    
- **Structure:** For **each chore** from the checklist, create an SOP entry that includes the following fields:
    
    - **Objective:** What is the goal of this procedure?
        
    - **Trigger:** When should this procedure be initiated (e.g., "Weekly," "When creating a new MOC," "When a link is broken")?
        
    - **Tools/Plugins:** List any Obsidian plugins or tools needed (e.g., "Obsidian Core Search," "Dataview Plugin," "Linter Plugin").
        
    - **Step-by-Step Instructions:** Provide a numbered list of the exact actions to take to complete the chore. Be explicit and clear.
```

## ⚙️Output: The Maintenance Workflow

```markdown
#### ⚙️Output: The Maintenance Workflow

Using the detailed SOP, design a cohesive maintenance workflow that organizes the chores into a logical and efficient system.

- **Format:** A text-based workflow description. Use nested lists or headings to show the structure.
    
- **Structure:** Group the SOPs/chores by frequency and context into the following categories:
    
    - **Daily Routine (5-10 mins):** Quick tasks to keep the system clean.
        
    - **Weekly Review (30-60 mins):** Deeper processing and organization.
        
    - **Monthly Check-up (1-2 hours):** Higher-level structural review.
        
    - **Quarterly/Annual Deep Clean:** Major system health checks.
        
    - **As-Needed (Contextual Triggers):** Chores performed only when a specific situation arises.
        
- **Logic:** Briefly explain the reasoning behind the grouping and the flow from one stage to the next (e.g., why daily inbox clearing precedes weekly processing).
```

---
## 🗓️Output: The Implementation Schedule

```markdown
#### 🗓️Output: The Implementation Schedule

Based on the established Workflow, create a practical and adaptable implementation schedule.

- **Format:** A Markdown table that serves as a weekly/monthly template.
    
- **Content:** The table should include the following columns:
    
    - `Frequency` (e.g., Daily, Weekly)
        
    - `Task/Chore` (Name of the chore from the workflow)
        
    - `Est. Time` (A reasonable time estimate, e.g., "5 min," "30 min")
        
    - `Scheduled Day/Time` (A placeholder like "Monday AM" or "End of Workday" that I can customize).
        
- **Guidance:** Include a short paragraph after the table providing advice on how to adapt this template to a personal rhythm and how to stay consistent.

# I'm uploading a **prompt idea** I have. *Read over this carefully.*

---

# *This is the prompt idea.*

## Prompt Idea

*Vault maintenance in my PKB.*

### **Persona/Role**

Should be some type of **PKB specialist** that works with **PKBs in the Obsidian environment.**
Maybe some kind of **SOP/Workflow designer** that specializes in **PKBs**?

### **Questions to Answer**

**Question I need Answered on Vault/PKB maintenance.**

- *What do you do to maintain an active PKB in Obsidian?*
- *How do you do this? *
- *Do you create a set schedule for tasks needing to be completed?*
- *Or do you do this inclemently as you work through the PKB daily?*
- *What types of activities do other top PKB users implement in order to maintain their vaults?*

### **Output**

- A academic styled report that can educate me on all the principle surrounding PKB maintenance.
