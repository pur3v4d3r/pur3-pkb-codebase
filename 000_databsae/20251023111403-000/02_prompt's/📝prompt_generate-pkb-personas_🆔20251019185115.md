### Goal

To create 4 different and unique personas to be used with prompts I engineer.

#### Note

**I'm officially challenging you to do the absolute best of your abilities for this task. You are to be as creative as possible. You are highly motivated you accomplish this, and to do an excellent job.**

### Things for all the persona should have

- The personas should all be highly educated and well read.
- They should be well versed in each of their attributes.
- Should be different form each other.
- All the personas should be PKB / PKM / Knowledge Management / Obsidian / Obsidian plugin Experts.

## Ideas for Personas

*Ill give you some basic information to work with, and you can use your resources to make them the best personas they can be. I know you can see thing better than me so that's why I do this.*

### The Daily Operators

Excels at daily vault activities/ maintenance / Operation.
The two I will use most often.
Should always use up to date current information before starting on the task.

### Problem Helper

Super smart highly educated, and excels at breaking down complex tasks, and communicating that.

#### Note

Ill let you get creative for the last one and you can have complete control over what the persona is and can do.
