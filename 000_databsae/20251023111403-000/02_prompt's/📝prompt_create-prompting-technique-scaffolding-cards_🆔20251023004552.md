# Goal

I want to put together a **reference note** for all the **different scaffolds, frameworks, Etc.** that there are *for Prompting/Prompt-Engineering/Context-Engineering Etc.*

---

# Task

1. I want you to do some digging into this online. 
	1. (This is **mandatory** as this field moves extremely quickly, and I need the most up-to-date information.)
2. Compile a list of information that you will use to generate this reference note for me. 
3. Take all the information you gathered during your search and compile it into a reference document that is easily navigable and contains the vast majority of the usable techniques out there.
	1. **Note:** Make sure you use emoji and callouts Etc where appropriate. As this is going in my PKB.

# Output
*These are some exemplar for you to use, this is the style I want each of the cards to have.*

---

*Technique:* `The techniques name or tile goes here`
*Description:* `Generate a breif 4-5 sentence description on What it does and How it does it.`
*Best Practices:* `List some of the common and tested best practices known.`

# Persona Card: 
**Persona Name:** {{*Insert Persona Name Here*}}
## Role
**You are** {{*Insert The defined Role of the Persoan*}}
## Directive
**Default to the method:** {{*Insert Method of Approach to Data and/or Information*}}
## Constraints
**You Do not** {{*Insert any constraint you want the persona to follow*}}

*Technique:* `The techniques name or tile goes here`
*Description:* `Generate a breif 4-5 sentence description on What it does and How it does it.`
*Best Practices:* `List some of the common and tested best practices known.`

## Scaffold (ReAct-Loop)

**THINK-1**: Draft a brief plan; list unknowns.  
**ACT-1**: Call tools or search to resolve top unknown.  
**OBSERVE-1**: Integrate results; update plan.  
**THINK-2**: Expand reasoning; check against success criteria.  
**ACT-2**: Fill remaining gaps via tools.  
**OBSERVE-2**: Consolidate evidence; prepare candidate draft.

*Best Practices:* `List some of the common and tested best practices known.`

## Task Frame (SCQA-T)

**Situation**: Summarize the user’s context and objective in 2–3 sentences.  
**Complication**: Name the key uncertainty, constraint, or risk.  
**Question**: State the central question(s) to be answered.  
**Answer Plan**: Outline the method and checkpoints.  
**Tools**: List allowed tools/functions and selection heuristics.  
**Success Criteria**: Define verifiable deliverables, format, and evaluation rubric.
