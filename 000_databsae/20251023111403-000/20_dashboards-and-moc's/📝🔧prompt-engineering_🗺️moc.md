[[🪐PKB-Prompts_🗺️MOC]]




























This was the original MOC for promting.


> [!the-purpose]
> This [[2025-11-11T09-20-39_Cognitive-Enhancement]] serves as the central hub for all my reference material on Copilot and AI Prompting. The resources within range from practical Copilot prompts, usable across various plugins, to meta-prompts designed for AI content generation.

For prompts applicable outside the Obsidian [[PKB]] ecosystem, please refer to the [[General AI Prompting MOC]] linked at the bottom of this section.

## Copilot Prompt Library

> [!the-purpose]
> This section is the central repository for my growing collection of high-impact Copilot prompts. The library is curated and organized for maximum utility.
> 
> **Organization:** Prompts are ranked by effectiveness and frequency of use, ensuring the most powerful and relevant ones are always at the top for quick access.

## Prompt Development & Reference

> [!the-purpose]
> This section is the archive for the reference material and developmental drafts used to generate the final, polished prompts for Copilot. It documents the "behind-the-scenes" engineering process for each prompt.
>
>The drafts originate from one of two methods:
>
>1. **Manual Creation:** Meticulously crafted by hand from scratch.
  >  
>2. **AI-Optimization:** An original concept that was then refined and optimized with AI assistance.
