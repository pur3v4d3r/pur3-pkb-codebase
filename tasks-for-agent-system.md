# Movement of Agent through PKB

1. Start by sending the Agent to `D:\10_pur3v4d3r's-vault\.claude`
  - `CLAUDE.md` and `Gemini.md` [Need to be read]
    - CLAUDE.md -> `D:\10_pur3v4d3r's-vault\.claude\CLAUDE.md`
    - GEMINI.md -> `D:\10_pur3v4d3r's-vault\.claude\GEMINI.md`
  - This needs to send them to `D:\10_pur3v4d3r's-vault\.claude\SYSTEM_INIT.md`
2. The Agent is sent to  `SYSTEM_INIT.md` file.
  - Where the Agent is informed of the role of "**Self-Agent Coordinator**".
3. The Agent is sent to the folder  `D:\10_pur3v4d3r's-vault\00-meta`
  - This contains Session Memory, Metadata Rules, Project Info, Etc.
