# The Isolation Principle as Engineering Discipline

> [!definition] The Isolation Principle as Engineering Discipline
> *Definition pending — derived from 1 source report(s).*

## Core Explanation

> [!evidence] The Isolation Principle as Engineering Discipline
> The practice of creating a virtual environment for every Python project — without exception — is not a convention born of pedantry but an engineering discipline rooted in the same principle that governs modular design in software architecture: components should not share hidden dependencies, because hidden dependencies create coupling that makes systems fragile, difficult to understand, and resistant to change. A project whose dependencies are explicit (listed in a `requirements.txt` file and installed in an isolated environment) can be reproduced, shared, and deployed reliably. A project whose dependencies are implicit (whatever happens to be installed in the system Python at the moment) works only by accident and will eventually break for reasons that are invisible without archaeology.
