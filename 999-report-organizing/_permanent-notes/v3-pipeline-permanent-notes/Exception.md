# Exception

> [!definition] Exception
> An exception is Python's mechanism for signaling that something has gone wrong during execution — not a crash in the catastrophic sense, but a structured notification that a specific operation could not be completed as requested. Exceptions carry a type (such as `TypeError`, `ValueError`, `FileNotFoundError`, or `KeyError`) that categorizes the nature of the failure, and a message (the string that follows the type) that provides human-readable context about what specifically went wrong. [[error-handling|Exception handling]] through `try/except` blocks allows the practitioner to anticipate specific failure modes and provide alternative behavior rather than letting the script terminate entirely — a pattern that becomes essential once scripts interact with external systems like files, networks, or user input that may not behave as expected.
