# The Situation: The Package That Broke Everything

## Core Explanation

> [!evidence] The Situation: The Package That Broke Everything
> You need to use the `requests` library to call a web [[api]]. Following a tutorial, you open the terminal and type `pip install requests`. It installs successfully. You add `import requests` to your script, and it works perfectly. Weeks later, you start a new project that requires `pandas` for data processing. You install it. Your new project works — but the old project, the one with `requests`, suddenly throws an error: `ImportError: cannot import name 'parse' from 'urllib3'`. You did not change anything in the old project. How can installing a package for a completely different project break something that was already working? The answer reveals one of the most consequential architectural decisions in Python development — and one that, if not addressed early, produces cascading problems of increasing severity as the practitioner's portfolio of scripts grows.
>
> **The core question:** Why do Python packages interact with each other at all, what is the mechanism by which installing one package can break another, and how does one prevent this from ever happening again?
