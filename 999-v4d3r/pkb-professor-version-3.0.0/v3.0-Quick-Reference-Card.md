---

## ⚡ Three-Tier System

**Tier 1 — Simple** (400-800 words)
```
Linear CoT + Verification
├─ When: Definitions, basic explanations
├─ Cost: ~1.5x baseline
└─ Example: "What is X?"
```

**Tier 2 — Standard** (1500-4000 words)
```
Enhanced CoT + Self-Consistency + CoVe
├─ When: Reference notes, technical guides
├─ Cost: ~3-5x baseline
└─ Example: "Explain how X works"
```

**Tier 3 — Complex** (4000+ words)
```
Full ToT + Multi-Path SC + Comprehensive CoVe
├─ When: Exhaustive references, multi-faceted analysis
├─ Cost: ~8-12x baseline
└─ Example: "Comprehensive overview of X"
```

## 🌳 Tree of Thoughts Pattern

```
1. DECOMPOSE: Break into 3-6 major dimensions
2. EXPLORE: Generate 3-5 reasoning paths per dimension
3. EVALUATE: Score paths on 4 criteria (1-10 scale)
4. SELECT: Choose best path(s) for each dimension
5. ELABORATE: Apply 4-layer Chain of Density
6. INTEGRATE: Synthesize across paths
```

**Scoring Criteria:**
- Explanatory Power
- Evidence Strength
- Pedagogical Clarity
- Completeness

---

## 🎯 Self-Consistency Protocol

```
FOR EACH CRITICAL CLAIM:

1. Generate 3-5 independent reasoning paths
2. Extract conclusion from each path
3. Majority vote determines final claim
4. Confidence = agreement percentage

IF agreement ≥80% → ^verified
IF agreement 60-80% → ^established  
IF agreement <60% → ^provisional or present multiple views
```

---

## ✅ Chain of Verification

```
STEP 1: Generate baseline response
STEP 2: Identify all factual claims
STEP 3: Create verification questions
STEP 4: Answer questions INDEPENDENTLY
        (critical: no baseline reference)
STEP 5: Integrate corrections into final
```

**Key Innovation:** Step 4 independence prevents confirmation bias

## 📊 Quality Checkpoints

**Pre-Generation:**
- [ ] All subtopics identified
- [ ] Word budgets allocated
- [ ] Reasoning tier selected
- [ ] Research plan created

**Mid-Generation:**
- [ ] Depth targets met per concept
- [ ] Layer requirements satisfied
- [ ] Progress on track

**Post-Generation (6 Dimensions, each 1-10):**
1. **Depth** — Coverage, layers, expert-level
2. **Structure** — Wiki-links, callouts, fields
3. **Complexity** — Vocabulary, precision
4. **Accuracy** — Verified claims, sources
5. **Pedagogy** — Analogies, examples
6. **Integration** — PKB connections

**Pass Threshold:** ≥8.0/10 composite score

## 🔧 Parameter Tuning

**Self-Consistency Paths:**
- Minimum: 3
- Standard: 5
- Critical claims: 7

**ToT Branching:**
- Paths per dimension: 3-5
- Maximum depth: 3-4 levels

**Research Budget:**
- Simple: 1-2 searches
- Standard: 2-4 searches
- Comprehensive: 4-8 searches

**Quality Threshold:**
- Balanced: 8.0/10
- High standards: 8.5/10

---

## 📈 Expected Performance

**vs. Baseline:**
- Hallucination reduction: 26-48%
- Reasoning accuracy: +15-20pp
- Depth: 2-3x more comprehensive
- Expert validation: 9/10 approval

**vs. v2.0:**
- Factual accuracy: +35-45%
- Structural compliance: +15-20%
- Research quality: +40-50%
- Overall quality: +25-35%

---

## ⚠️ Critical Reminders

**ALWAYS:**
- Use structured thinking phases
- Generate multiple paths for critical claims
- Verify facts independently (no confirmation bias)
- Enforce quality checkpoints
- Assign honest confidence markers

**NEVER:**
- Skip validation (8.0/10 minimum required)
- Present unverified factual claims
- Use single-source validation
- Output thinking blocks to user
- Apply Tier 3 to simple queries (inefficient)
