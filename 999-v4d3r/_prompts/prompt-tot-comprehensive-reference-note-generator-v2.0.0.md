# Prompt Analysis & Redesign

## Phase 1: Analysis of Source Prompt

### Structural Assessment

The source prompt is a sophisticated reference note generator with several well-designed components:

**Strengths Identified:**
1. **Rich semantic markup systems** — Epistemic confidence, atomic extraction, application context, synthesis potential, temporal decay, mental model anchors, counterexamples, prerequisite mapping
2. **Clear output scaffold** — Detailed callout taxonomy with proper Obsidian-native formatting
3. **Multi-phase architecture** — Research → Planning → Construction pipeline
4. **Quality enforcement** — Anti-patterns and execution parameters defined

**Critical Gaps Identified:**

| Gap | Current State | Impact |
|-----|---------------|--------|
| **Linear search pattern** | "Execute AT LEAST 5 distinct searches" — flat, unstructured | Same searches yield similar results regardless of topic; no adaptive exploration |
| **Missing CoT exemplars** | "Show your thinking" instruction without demonstration | LLM must infer reasoning patterns; inconsistent quality |
| **No branching logic** | Structural planning mentions "Tree-of-Thoughts" but doesn't operationalize it | Topic dimensions explored superficially; depth sacrificed for breadth |
| **No backtracking protocol** | When a search branch is unproductive, no pivot mechanism | Wasted tokens on dead ends; incomplete coverage |
| **Token inefficiency** | Multiple marker systems have redundant specification | ~40% of prompt tokens are repeated structural templates |

### Redesign Objectives

1. **Implement true ToT (Depth-First)** — Each topic dimension becomes a branch; explore deeply before broadening
2. **Add concrete CoT exemplars** — Demonstrate reasoning patterns for definition analysis, relationship mapping, and application derivation
3. **Add branch evaluation heuristics** — When to go deeper, when to pivot, when to terminate
4. **Consolidate semantic systems** — Merge redundant marker specifications into unified protocol
5. **Reduce token overhead** — Eliminate structural repetition while preserving functionality

DEPTH-FIRST ORDER: D1 → D1.1 → D1.1.1 → D1.1.2 → D1.2 → D2 → ...
```

### Component Design

**1. Tree Initialization Protocol**
- Decompose topic into 3-5 primary dimensions (not more)
- Each dimension becomes a branch root
- Assign exploration priority based on: centrality to topic, likely information density, user's PKB gaps

**2. Depth-First Exploration Mechanics**
- For each branch: SEARCH → EVALUATE → BRANCH_OR_BACKTRACK
- Evaluation criteria:
  - **Saturation**: No new non-redundant information in last 2 searches
  - **Depth limit**: Maximum 4 levels deep (prevents rabbit holes)
  - **Relevance threshold**: If findings drift >50% from topic core, prune

**3. CoT Exemplar Integration**
- 3 worked examples embedded in prompt:
  - **Concept Analysis**: How to derive definitions and distinctions
  - **Relationship Mapping**: How to identify connections and dependencies
  - **Application Derivation**: How to translate theory to practice

**4. Synthesis Protocol**
- After all branches explored, cross-branch integration phase
- Identify: contradictions, reinforcements, emergent patterns
- Generate: synthesis section, mental model anchors, knowledge graph connections

## 🌳 Tree of Thoughts: Depth-First Exploration Protocol

### Phase 1: Tree Initialization

**STEP 1.1: Topic Decomposition**

Before any search, decompose the topic into 3-5 PRIMARY DIMENSIONS. These become your branch roots.

```
DECOMPOSITION TEMPLATE (output in <thinking>):

TOPIC: [User's topic]

PRIMARY DIMENSIONS IDENTIFIED:
├── DIMENSION 1: [Name] — [Why this is a core facet]
│   └── Initial questions: [What needs answering here?]
├── DIMENSION 2: [Name] — [Why this is a core facet]
│   └── Initial questions: [What needs answering here?]
├── DIMENSION 3: [Name] — [Why this is a core facet]
│   └── Initial questions: [What needs answering here?]
├── DIMENSION 4: [Name] — [Why this is a core facet] (if applicable)
└── DIMENSION 5: [Name] — [Why this is a core facet] (if applicable)

EXPLORATION PRIORITY ORDER:
1. [Dimension X] — Rationale: [Most foundational / most complex / most novel]
2. [Dimension Y] — Rationale: [...]
3. [...]
```

**STEP 1.2: Branch Priority Assignment**

Assign priority based on:
- **Centrality**: How essential is this to understanding the topic core?
- **Density**: How much information likely exists here?
- **Novelty**: How likely to contain non-obvious insights?
- **Dependencies**: Does this need to be understood before others?

---

### Phase 2: Depth-First Exploration

**EXECUTION PATTERN:**
```
FOR each dimension (in priority order):
    EXPLORE_BRANCH(dimension, depth=1)
    
FUNCTION EXPLORE_BRANCH(node, depth):
    IF depth > MAX_DEPTH (4): RETURN
    
    // SEARCH STEP
    EXECUTE web_search for this node
    RECORD findings
    
    // EVALUATE STEP
    ASSESS: saturation? relevance? sub-branches needed?
    
    IF needs_deeper_exploration:
        GENERATE sub-branches (2-3 specific aspects)
        FOR each sub_branch:
            EXPLORE_BRANCH(sub_branch, depth + 1)  // RECURSE
    ELSE:
        BACKTRACK to parent or next sibling
```

**BRANCH EXPLORATION TEMPLATE (repeat for each node):**

```
EXPLORING: [Node name] (Depth: X/4)
├── Parent: [Parent node or ROOT]
├── Exploration rationale: [Why exploring this now]
│
├── SEARCH EXECUTION:
│   ├── Query: "[Specific search query]"
│   ├── Query rationale: [What this should reveal]
│   └── Alternative queries if needed: [Backup queries]
│
├── FINDINGS SUMMARY:
│   ├── Key discoveries: [Bullet list]
│   ├── Unexpected insights: [What surprised you]
│   └── Gaps remaining: [What's still unclear]
│
├── BRANCH EVALUATION:
│   ├── Saturation check: [YES/NO - seeing redundant results?]
│   ├── Relevance check: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW - still on topic?]
│   └── Depth decision: [GO DEEPER / BACKTRACK / PIVOT]
│
└── SUB-BRANCHES GENERATED (if going deeper):
    ├── Sub-branch A: [Specific aspect to explore]
    ├── Sub-branch B: [Specific aspect to explore]
    └── Sub-branch C: [Specific aspect to explore] (optional)
```

---

### Phase 3: Backtracking & Termination

**BACKTRACK TRIGGERS:**
- ✓ Saturation: Last 2 searches yielded <20% new information
- ✓ Depth limit: Reached level 4
- ✓ Relevance drift: >50% of findings unrelated to topic core
- ✓ Dead end: No credible sources for this sub-branch

**TERMINATION CRITERIA:**
- All priority dimensions explored to saturation or depth limit
- Cross-dimensional patterns identified
- Minimum 8 distinct searches completed (may be more based on topic complexity)

**EXPLORATION TREE SUMMARY (generate at end of search phase):**

```
FINAL EXPLORATION TREE:

[TOPIC ROOT]
├── DIMENSION 1: [Name] ★ [saturation/depth-limited/pruned]
│   ├── D1.1: [Name] — [status]
│   │   ├── D1.1.1: [Name] — [status]

Use these exemplars as templates for your reasoning. Show your thinking explicitly.

---

### Exemplar 1: Concept Analysis (Deriving Definitions & Distinctions)

**TASK:** Define "Cognitive Load" and distinguish its subtypes

**REASONING CHAIN:**

```
STEP 1: CORE IDENTIFICATION
├── Question: What is the essential nature of this concept?
├── Observation: "Cognitive load" appears in educational psychology literature
├── Core insight: It refers to mental effort during information processing
└── Working definition: "The total amount of mental activity imposed on working memory at any given moment"

STEP 2: BOUNDARY CLARIFICATION
├── Question: What is this concept NOT?
├── Analysis: Not the same as "difficulty" (difficulty is objective; load is subjective experience)
├── Analysis: Not the same as "stress" (load is cognitive; stress includes emotional components)
└── Distinction: Cognitive load is specifically about working memory demands, not general mental strain

STEP 3: INTERNAL STRUCTURE
├── Question: Does this concept have meaningful subtypes?
├── Investigation: Literature distinguishes three types (Sweller et al.)
├── Subtype 1: Intrinsic load — inherent to material complexity
├── Subtype 2: Extraneous load — imposed by poor presentation
├── Subtype 3: Germane load — productive effort toward schema construction
└── Relationship: Total load = Intrinsic + Extraneous + Germane (must not exceed capacity)

STEP 4: SYNTHESIS
├── Final definition: [Refined based on analysis]
├── Key distinctions: [What it is vs. what it isn't]
├── Internal structure: [Subtypes and their relationships]
└── Confidence level: ESTABLISHED (multiple meta-analyses, textbook consensus)
```

**OUTPUT:** Use this reasoning pattern when:
- Defining technical terms
- Distinguishing similar concepts
- Identifying subtypes within a category

---

### Exemplar 2: Relationship Mapping (Identifying Connections & Dependencies)

**TASK:** Map how "Working Memory" relates to adjacent concepts

**REASONING CHAIN:**

```
STEP 1: IDENTIFY RELATIONSHIP TYPES
├── Question: What kinds of relationships might exist?
├── Taxonomy:
│   ├── IS-A (taxonomic): Is working memory a type of something?
│   ├── PART-OF (mereological): Is it a component of a larger system?
│   ├── CAUSES/ENABLES: What does it make possible?
│   ├── DEPENDS-ON: What does it require?
│   └── CONTRASTS-WITH: What is it distinguished from?

STEP 2: MAP EACH RELATIONSHIP TYPE
├── IS-A relationships:
│   └── Working memory IS-A memory system (alongside long-term, sensory)
├── PART-OF relationships:
│   └── Working memory is PART-OF the cognitive architecture
├── CAUSES/ENABLES relationships:
│   ├── ENABLES: reasoning, language comprehension, problem-solving
│   ├── ENABLES: learning (transfer to long-term memory)
│   └── CONSTRAINS: cognitive load capacity
├── DEPENDS-ON relationships:
│   ├── DEPENDS-ON: attention (for maintenance)
│   └── DEPENDS-ON: executive function (for manipulation)
└── CONTRASTS-WITH relationships:
    └── CONTRASTS-WITH: long-term memory (capacity, duration, encoding)

STEP 3: IDENTIFY KEY DEPENDENCIES
├── Question: What must be understood BEFORE working memory?
├── Hard prerequisites: attention, basic memory concepts
├── Soft prerequisites: information processing theory
└── Dependency chain: Attention → Working Memory → Cognitive Load Theory

STEP 4: SYNTHESIZE RELATIONSHIP MAP
├── Central connections: [Most important relationships]
├── Prerequisite chain: [What comes before]
├── Extension paths: [What builds on this]
└── Cross-domain bridges: [Connections outside home domain]
```

**OUTPUT:** Use this reasoning pattern when:
- Building knowledge graph connections
- Identifying prerequisites
- Planning expansion topics

---

### Exemplar 3: Application Derivation (Theory → Practice Translation)

**TASK:** Derive practical applications from "Spacing Effect" principle

**REASONING CHAIN:**

```
STEP 1: EXTRACT CORE MECHANISM
├── Question: What is the underlying mechanism that makes this work?
├── Principle: Distributed practice > massed practice for retention
├── Mechanism: Forgetting-retrieval cycles strengthen memory traces
└── Key variable: Time intervals between practice sessions

STEP 2: IDENTIFY APPLICATION DOMAINS
├── Question: Where do people need to retain information?
├── Domain scan:
│   ├── Education: Students learning curriculum content
│   ├── Professional: Skill maintenance, certification
│   ├── Personal: Language learning, hobby skills
│   └── Technical: Spaced repetition software design

STEP 3: DERIVE SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS (per domain)
├── Education domain:
│   ├── Application: Curriculum pacing with review cycles
│   ├── Trigger: "When designing syllabus" → space major topics
│   ├── Implementation: Return to topics 1 week, 1 month, 3 months later
│   └── Anti-pattern: Cramming all content in single unit without return
├── Technical domain:
│   ├── Application: SRS algorithm design
│   ├── Trigger: "When building flashcard systems"
│   ├── Implementation: Expanding intervals (1d → 3d → 7d → 14d → 30d)
│   └── Anti-pattern: Fixed intervals regardless of performance

STEP 4: IDENTIFY BOUNDARY CONDITIONS
├── Question: When does this principle NOT apply or apply differently?
├── Boundary 1: Very short retention needs (next-day exam) — massing may suffice
├── Boundary 2: Motor skills — optimal spacing differs from declarative knowledge
├── Boundary 3: High initial difficulty — may need massing first, then spacing
└── Application note: Check boundaries before applying principle

STEP 5: SYNTHESIZE APPLICATION PROTOCOL
├── Primary applications: [Domain + trigger + action]
├── Anti-patterns: [What not to do]
├── Boundary conditions: [When to modify or skip]
└── Confidence: VERIFIED (robust across meta-analyses)
```

**OUTPUT:** Use this reasoning pattern when:
- Translating theory to practice
- Generating application context markers
- Identifying trigger conditions and anti-patterns

### Quality Gates

**Before exiting <thinking>:**
- [ ] Minimum 8 searches executed
- [ ] All priority dimensions explored to saturation or limit
- [ ] Cross-branch synthesis completed
- [ ] No major gaps unaddressed

**Before finalizing output:**
- [ ] All callout types used appropriately
- [ ] Wiki-link density target met (15-40)
- [ ] Epistemic confidence markers applied
- [ ] PKB integration sections complete
- [ ] Expansion topics generated with rationale

### Anti-Patterns

❌ Linear search without branching logic
❌ Breadth-first exploration (hitting all dimensions superficially)
❌ Reasoning without explicit chains
❌ Missing backtracking when branch exhausted
❌ Synthesis skipped before content generation
❌ Bullet-list-only sections (prose required)
❌ Generic expansion topics without connection rationale

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->

<final_instruction>

## 🎯 Activation

When user provides a topic:

1. **IMMEDIATELY** enter `<thinking>` block
2. **EXECUTE** Phases 1-5 (tree initialization through content planning)
3. **EXIT** thinking block
4. **GENERATE** reference note following output scaffold (Phase 6)

The exploration tree drives content structure. Each explored branch becomes a section. Depth achieved determines detail level.

**Remember:** 
- **DEPTH-FIRST** — Go deep on one dimension before moving to next
- **SHOW REASONING** — Use CoT exemplars as templates for all analytical work
- **BACKTRACK EXPLICITLY** — Document when and why you pivot
- **SYNTHESIZE BEFORE WRITING** — Integration happens in thinking, not output

**This is a REFERENCE NOTE.** Exhaustiveness achieved through systematic depth-first exploration, not surface-level breadth.
